1,2020-03-19 11:03:00," topic: grades Firstly, in response to someone arguing that they dont know anyone opposed to being forces to take all classes mandatory S/NC, I know several several people that are. As far as the people worried about medical students being in difficult positions where they cant take classes S/NC, I cant imagine that a medical school would not understand if you explained that you were unable to cope in the middle of a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. As far as any kind of reason goes, thats as good as gets and Im certain as someone with pre med siblings at Brown that you will have the opportunity to explain. They understand if you needed to S/NC because you were in a de stabilising position or your family was affected but someone else was in a more privileged position. HOWEVER, how will others who need their grades this semester, especially upperclassmen, be able to cope with this, especially when they dont have had reduced courseloads or a bad GPA due to similarly extenuating circumstances in the past few semesters (severe mental or physical health issues, loss of a family member etc.)? Although people argue that those who want S/NC to be an option, not something that is forced, should get off their high horse, I hope you guys can at least attempt to sympathise with people in this position. Some students need these grades due to equally extenuating, difficult circumstances in the past, and deserve the option to take them for a grade if they want to, just as those in difficult circumstances now deserve the option to take them S/NC."""

Those whos families cannot support them, who never learned how to write an essay in their person high school English class, who worry about affording food (let alone a week supply) are set up to sink. Those with privilege and institutional knowledge get waterwings and swimming lessons, then get an A as a trophy to show off their hard earned (?) success. There are of course exceptions; there is no shortage of successful, brilliant, underprivileged people, nor a dearth of dedicated, hardworking silver spooners.

It not about the grade. It about making sure that people are not penalized for having less resources back home. When students are expected to worry about basic needs like food and health on top of studying for classes (or even having a space to productively study), while others live in luxury of having office/study space within their homes and no lack of food, I don think the option to s/nc is enough. I premed and low income. Already my low income status is a disadvantage for me in med school admissions, but me and my decision to s/nc while worrying about food security (against another applicant whose resources allowed them to keep up with the rigid grading system) should not have to count against me and further add to my anxiety during this time. s/nc does not mean you are not working hard.

60,2020-03-18 03:05:00," Its important to recognize that lots of students who worked really hard and did get good grades throughout the semester would be at a massive disadvantage going forward given reasons of accessibility (for example, Zoom isnt available in some countries), or just because learning remotely and/or in different time zones is a massive barrier to many and not all professors are so accommodating. Although I understand that some people feel like giving everyone As drives up grade inflation and thus decreases the value of their own hard work, its also very true that only giving students the option to S/NC courses if they face significant barriers even if they worked really hard before can similarly (and likely to a greater extent) devalue their work. Many of you dont want to put everyone on S/NC because of this exact reason, and its quite ableist to expect that hardworking students would either have to take a lower grade due to the barriers they now face or opt into S/NC for their courses and decrease the value of their transcript. I think the net loss in whatever harm the grade inflation does (I personally doubt employers and grad schools will really look at or judge the measures Brown takes to mitigate the toll of this pandemic on our academic abilities) of giving everyone As will be massively offset by its emotional and academic boon alongside making up for the increased barriers many if not most students now face without forcing them to have to choose between a lower grade and devaluing their work through S/NC. In my mind, the most widely appealing solution is to allow students to freeze their grades where they are right now as a representation of their traditional academic performance or unfreeze them if they want to try to raise those grades, but I nonetheless think that giving everyone As is already far better than either keeping the system as it is or only giving out extended S/NC deadlines."""

I think its safe to say that COVID counts as a major problem for all our academic pursuits, and the transition to online classes makes things extraordinarily difficult for those who rely on attending in person lectures and sections to learn.

81,2020-03-18 03:03:00," People are making the case for extending the S/NC deadline, which makes sense...but is giving EVERYONE an extended S/NC deadline necessary (and conducive to rigor)? Would it be better if the administration grants these extensions on a case by case basis (but at the same time urges the deans to be understanding for a variety of circumstances)? Also, I hope that IF there are classes that are still doing closed book/timed exams, please ensure that there is some effective proctoring mechanism (ex: real time proctoring over zoom? videotaping the exam session?). Again, if this is especially difficult for some students, there should be accommodating measures after discussions. """

106,2020-03-17 03:20:00," TL;DR Brown should extend the S/NC deadlines once professors make virtual classes clearer, forcing everyone to take classes S/NC is extreme and unfair. Honestly, I think the best policy would be if Brown extended the S/NC deadline for all students after Professors have clearly explained how their classes and exams are going to be conducted for the rest of the semester. I completely believe that its only fair that students that might struggle due to these terrible and super de stabilising circumstances deserve the option to take their classes S/NC. However, its valid that a lot of students really need their grades this semester that theyve worked real lot hard for to boost their GPAs, especially rising juniors and seniors. Its unfair to be forced to take classes S/NC for students that have worked very hard and are willing and able to handle with virtual classes for the sake of their GPAs."""

It can be obnoxious hearing about how we wont have a ~ senior spring ~. But consider that we dont have any more springs left at brown at all.

The coronavirus has me feeling the full weight of being a low income student. In this moment when many of my peers, unencumbered by the constraints of finances, only need to concern themselves with putting their items in storage and getting back home, I have to ask: will I have enough to eat if/when I get back home ? Will I be safe at home? How am I going to support my family if I can work my on campus job? If I go home, where am I going to sleep, the couch or the floor? My family doesn have adequate health insurance so how much can I pay out of pocket to help with medical expenses? How much will the University health insurance cover me out of state should I fall ill? Will I have the money for co pays or a hospital stay? Where should I put my items in storage? Can I afford it? I hope the University will help financially where it can, but its incredibly isolating when so many of my peers don have as many layers to think through. Its odd to rub shoulders with the children of some of the world wealthiest people, to be just as talented, intelligent, and capable but to know the only thing that seperates us is that one of us was born lucky and the other not so much. To know that much of that wealth was built on the backs of working class people like me . Its odd to know that some students come from families with multiple homes, some in isolated locations where they can bunker down and wait this pandemic out comfortably, but some of us have nowhere to go at all. I know I figure out the answer to all these questions but even now when we are all suffering, we not all suffering the same. I feel so vulnerable. It sucks to be low income at a time like this. ~Dont forget about low income kids~"

At first, when coronavirus was relatively contained, I pointed out that the flu does cause more deaths and more people should worry about that. As the coronavirus spreads, it has the potential to kill and severely hurt more people than the flu. We should still be trying to contain this virus as best as possible ffs. Stop thinking about only yourselves for one minute (boo boo, my senior spring isnt perfect!) and think about how many people can be severely hurt or KILLED by this. And wash your fucking hands for twenty seconds you creeps, and cover your coughs and sneezes even if they are not caused by a cold/flu."""

I found it useful to keep them in loop for help in the process. In order to get accommodations you have to go through neuropsych testing I think, though that is not a required part of adhd diagnosis in general and this is expensive. SEAS helped cover my copay after the fact if that something people need too. You can just ask them I think. Personally I used Neuropsychology Partners in East Providence, it was a good experience. For time scale, it took me super long :(, but it probably varies by place. First getting a slot with SEAS took some weeks (but it was mid sem so idk). All the testing jazz happens on one day (in the place i went to) and takes like hrs so I couldn find any time on a weekday morning to do it during the semester. Also these places have long lines. So there was a two month gap between booking the appointment after emailing back and forth and going. It took them more weeks to get back on a full report but I got a confirmation on that day. One can get interim accommodations from SEAS while all this waiting is happening. Also SEAS and Health Services can give info on therapy, support groups around here, coaching etc if one asks though you could prob google or use zencare. Anyway, I hope this is helpful. SEAS can answer most questions too. Good luck!"

Everything Bernie, Warren, Democrats, and progressives ever stood for is going to take a sledgehammer with a Trump Presidency. It would mean the continuing takeover of an authoritarian rule. Trump has argued he is immune from indictments, from oversight, from the courts, and he has a DOJ and Republican Senate to help him solidify his role as America King. It would mean further emboldening of a worrying white nationalist, conspiratorial presence in America. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, wild conspiracies, and more would be given a green light.

664,2020-03-08 11:26:00," topics: coronavirus CORONAVIRUS Q&A Tl;dr Take actions because we shall be responsible for preventing a huge pandemic; Mixed results on whether face masks are effective or not; Your Chinese international friends might be going crazy oof How is it different from the flu? Shall I be more cautious? The known symptoms for the flu and COVID are nearly identical: fever, cough, body aches and fatigue. However, there are a couple of important differences: average incubation period for the flu is two days, but for for COVID it days. This is exactly why the outbreak in China was so bad. People without apparent symptoms traveling around the country, later causing a sudden increase in reported cases. coronavirus seems to be more deadly than the flu so far. The global case fatality rate for people infected with coronavirus was . percent according to the WHO, where as the death rate from seasonal flu is typically around .% in the U.S. contagious it is. Each person with the coronavirus appears to infect . other people, comparing to roughly . for the flu. You SHOULD be cautious. The death rate for a young and healthy person is low, and yes, it might not be too much worse than a flu. But the terrifying thing about a pandemic is the spreading. COVID can be very deadly for older people or people with underlying conditions. If there an outbreak at Brown, the most impacted could be faculty and staff with older/immunosuppressed family members who live together with them, and your own family members if you travel back home for spring break. Taking action is our responsibility as a community member. Why are my Chinese international friends so stressed and cautious? Because we are watching the same process happening again, in the exact same way. About two months ago when I was back in Beijing, the situation of the outbreak, the government actions, and the public reaction were strikingly similar to how the US was responding in the past two weeks. Government thinking that the outbreak would be under control, people believing that the cases would be limited to a few locations, testing not being distributed widely so confirmed cases were artificially low, large gatherings still going on with no precautions. But then all of a sudden the number of cases skyrocketed, mostly community spread. Seeing the exact same process developing again in the US has been extremely frustrating and hopeless, especially when we know that the US had a chance to avoid an outbreak by learning from what has happened in China, Korea, Italy, etc. Why are some people wearing masks? In some places/cultures, such as where I from, wearing a mask is not associated with being sick. Some people are used to seeing people on the street wearing masks for pollution and flu prevention etc etc. Research on the effectiveness of mask in preventing flu infection shows mixed results. In fact, both WHO and the US CDC suggest that healthy individuals don need to wear a mask. However, with regards to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese public health/medical officials have been suggesting (or even enforcing) mask wearing for several reasons (that might be unique to the situation in China) extremely high traffic load around the Chinese New Year (around billion travels across the entire nation), high population density making hand washing in public areas not that accessible, and most importantly, the days incubation period of the coronavirus leading to many potential asymptomatic virus carriers that could lead to uncontrollable spreading in urban areas with dense population. Thus, some Chinese students might bring this mindset and decide to wear a mask to protect themselves and OTHERS AROUND THEM. They are on the more cautious side, but definitely not unreasonable considering the long incubation period making a lot of people potential virus carriers. It everybody personal choice, and since the research is showing mixed results, everybody has a valid reason."""

766,2020-03-06 01:14:00," Honest question. To what extent do you believe that historic oppression of a persons ancestors can be equated to present day oppression? As an example, I am Jewish, and I grew up rarely encountering explicit antisemitism (at least in person) and I dont think being Jewish has ever been used against me in a hiring decision or something like that. But if you go back just two or three more generations, my ancestors were beaten, killed, imprisoned, exiled, etc. because of their religion, and that was pretty common on and off for literally thousands of years. My question is, what does that mean for me? Black Americans continue to experience discrimination and bigotry that clearly stem from the evils of the past. But in my case, all of the horrible stuff that happened to my ancestors doesnt really harm me in any clear way. I think this is a common feeling among American Jews. Many of us are pretty well off socioeconomically. We tend to look similar to white Christians. We are well represented in politics and other positions. That all protects us from a lot of the oppression that our ancestors faced, which is great. But it also allows us and others to forget that Jews have been and are an oppressed people. So to what extent can Jews identify as an oppressed group that deserves support and solidarity from others? Or should a well off American Jew just be thankful that they are now privileged, unlike their ancestors? I am asking this in a public forum because Im interested in what members of other marginalized groups have to say about this, in addition to just other Jews."""

Men run away from you the moment you miss a period anyway, so why not get abortions? For years, men have been coddled to believe they can have sex with no consequence. But then their father politicians have a cow when those consequences of men hating condoms get taken care of by women. Listen assholes Im going to introduce you to the concept of your problem. Getting pregnant with your baby and now you think that in the middle of dodging child support youd actually miss the little thing if it was aborted? Your problem. Getting an STD because the thought didnt occur to you that if somebody wasnt asking you for protection, theyre not asking the other guys for it either? Your problem. Suck it up and take your Valtrex. Im done serving your agenda. And health services can shut their trap about moralistic crap and just refill my prescription. """

1004,2020-03-03 04:49:00," topics: dem nom .I actually very undecided on who to support in my upcoming primary. Most of my friends I talk to dont think much about politics or are just a Bernie echo chamber so I wanted to get some more opinions. Here are the most important policies for me: . Education. I think that we dont actually have good solutions to a lot of societys problems, and for the problems where we do have good solutions, people wont listen. We live in a country where % of people think that chocolate milk comes from brown cows and % of people dont believe in evolution. How can we even expect our democracy to represent the will of the people when people dont even know what it is they want, or how different policies will affect them? Its embarrassing, in my opinion, that a populist such as Trump could win over the republican party without even embodying conservative values. He was just a salesmen, and millions of people bought his pitch. We need better critical reasoning skills than that if we have any chance of having a more stable government in the future and any chance of solving every other long term issue. . Gun control. The point of the second amendment was to protect us against a tyrannical government, and the hundreds of millions of firearms in the country right now cant even do thatinstead they just cost us thousands of lives every year. I want much stricter gun regulation (background checks, fingerprint locks, ideally buybacks) along with an extension of other licenses that can be given out to civilians. In particular, I think it would be impossible for us to fight against the military in the slightest unless we as civilians have access to tanks, fighter jets, and SAMs, and I think that with sufficient training (maybe thousands of hours) a civilian could be taught to use these safely. Such a program would actually safe more lives than it would cost via accidents or malicious use because in the long run, with the government becoming more authoritarian and listening less and less to reasonable voters, there will likely come a point where our human rights and our democracy are at risk. And at that point, we will all be glad that some guy down the street went through the incredibly extensive background checks and safety trainings to be rolling that tank down to capitol hill. . Fiscal responsibility. I am very concerned about our nations deficit and debt and the long term financial impact those two will have on our children. I want a president who wont just turn us into the next Greece. . Climate change. The US (not to mention pretty much every other country in the world) will take enormous hits to health, agriculture, and their economies if climate change continuous worsening at the pace its at. The US contributes relatively little to this worsening (%), so I want someone who can think bigger than just the green new deal; we need to pull in other countries (read: India and China) to start making serious changes in their climate policy, and we need to come up with serious innovations that allow us to fix the problem more than it looks like any proposed domestic policy is able to. I am genuinely curious to hear others opinions on these issues and which candidate you think will be best. """

Zionism describes the belief that the only Jewish state in modern history has a right to exist. It started as a reaction to the violent forms of anti Semitism that pretty much every Jew in the western world faced on a regular basis and it only became reality when the rest of the world decided to finally stop ignoring the fact that Jews were being either systematically persecuted or popularly massacred (pre holocaust pogroms, the holocaust, post holocaust pogroms, etc). The first inhabitants of Israel weren religious Jews flocking to the holy land, they were refugees fleeing to pretty much the only place where they were welcome. If you disagree with how the formation of Israel was implemented or the contemporary actions of the Israeli government towards the Palestinians, I okay with that (in fact, I a Jewish Zionist and I heavily criticize the actions of Netanyahu). But if you wanna call somebody a racist for looking at history and saying that the safe haven for one of the most universally persecuted minorities had and continues to have its place in the world, then maybe take it down a notch."""

However, I argue that we shouldn waste our time & emotional energy worrying about mass shootings precisely because they kill fewer people than the flu. This doesn mean gun control is a bad idea of course we should pass universal background checks, assault rifle bans, etc. But it silly to worry about highly unlikely scenarios that you have no control over. Similarly, we should all take commonsense public health measures seriously in a time like this, but let not panic over something that is unlikely to substantially alter our lives. When we respond to problems like this with panic, our panic can be more dangerous than the problems themselves, because it makes us more willing to encroach on other people freedoms (and give up our own)."

The fact that superdelegates are now saying theyre willing to override the first ballot to secure their own class interests is absurd. The superdelegate system needs to be abolished. And for those of you who claimed that Bernie supported superdelegates in the past he didnt. Unlike in this cycle, in superdelegates were part of the first ballot in each state and hundreds of them had already pledged their support to Hillary before a single state had voted, and even in states where Bernie won the majority vote most of the state superdelegates went to Hillary. And of course the total delegate count is used in the media, so this had a snowballing effect for Hillary. What he was calling for was simply that the superdelegates change their votes to align correctly with states they had each won."""

Even at schools with affirmative action like Brown, these groups populations are generally small. This all comes in the context of America as a system (including its higher education ) being built upon centuries of the subjegation and slavery of blacks and native Americans. Folks never mention that the American dream is built upon the bodies of natives and African Americans. While you and your family may have expierenced racism, you all are still here to achieve a better life. Blacks and natives were the tools used to provide that better life. TLDR: Killing affirmative action would block most non Asian POC from attending schools like Brown.

1299,2020-03-01 01:02:00," In response to tread lightly if you do talk to CAPs because its not just about being on meds. Not sure which stage of the investigation process youre in but essentially any government employer granting you a clearance can and will ask if you have ever seen a mental health professional. If you tell them you have, then they will send some sort of legally binding letter to the doctor to confirm what sort of help you required, diagnoses, medications received, and do they think you are mentally sound to handle a high stress job guarding national security. You will be asked by the doctor if they have your permission to break doctor/patient confidentiality. If you say yes, they send off the information to the government agency. If you refuse, they dont send the information and you break the conditional offer of employment. If you have a history of suicidal ideation, thoughts of suicide, self harm, severe anger issues, frequent panic attacks, or a major mental health disorders, it is unlikely that you will be hired because of the nature of working in a cleared environment. Or they will put you on some type of probationary period if you are very lucky. That said, if you are having temporary or grief related mental health issues in relation to a specific event (x. someone close died, horrific car accident, hazing, sexual assault), then the rules become a little grayer and they are usually more lenient with you if you stay honest. Whatever you decide to do, you should under no circumstances lie to the employer. There are health and mental resources for you once you start at the job if needed. My advice would be to hold out until May if you can. Talk to friends or family, or peer support groups, but avoid a formalized setting of seeing a mental health professional, doctor, nurse, etc if possible. Be mindful that when you are being investigated, the employer will talk to just about anyone and everyone that knows you. !!!However!!! You should absolutely take care of your needs first and see a professional if you are having a crisis which could end with you harming yourself or others. Stay well."""

There are tons of other viable career options that allow you to be financially stable and contribute to the betterment of this world for everyone, not just the rich and wealthy.

Do you not find it morally abhorrent that your life work will have been making the rich richer and the poor poorer?

But when there are so many other fulfilling and wholesome job prospects, I can imagine choosing Wall Street.

How many of you clicked the link and looked at the building (which looks fine), thinking its the same one being discussed? The picture is of a residence hall at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA. If you dont like the look of that one, here are other Deborah Berkes that I think are even prettier: https://www.instagram.com/p// https://www.dberke.com/work/ princeton university residential colleges collegeshttps://www.dberke.com/work/ lewis international law center harvard law school Though the post was very misleading, I dont think that was intentional. However, even if this were the proposed dorm, I would be ecstatic about its Platinum LEED certification. Brown (unlike some other Ivies) hasnt yet built or retrofitted a single one of its buildings to earn this badge of sustainability. As it stands, the actual proposed dorm is planned to live up to only Silver LEED standards. https://www.brown.edu/sustainability/initiatives/building design construction leed Setting aside the alleged ugliness of Dickinson College, other students voiced more legitimate concerns about the displacement of local businesses, particularly of Bagel Gourmet and Mini Mart (whose presence, as a nearby resident, I will deeply miss). "" ...I propose we pour our righteous indignation into getting Brown to include ground floor commercial space in the new dorm building... Local businesses students love and new student housing is better than either one alone"""" This seems to already be in the works. According to the University release on the , part of the cost will also be covered by renting out the ground floor (approximately square feet) as retail space. Brown is supporting the businesses for relocation, and will obviously pay for the purchase and demolishing of the existing structures. https://www.browndailyherald.com////brown announces new residence hall plan/?fbclid= All of the facts that Ive laid out so far require minimal research and a thumbs scroll down from a knee jerk reaction to a DB link. I myself am guilty for mistaking the picture as the proposal at first glance. But the reason why I write this post is to hopefully dispel what I see as a concerning reactionary trend among my fellow progressives, exemplified by this DB commenter: ~The problem with capitalism is this. This. We really need to support small businesses rather than let large private entities like Brown do whatever they want~ Well meaning people who are constantly inundated in valid critiques of our status quos systemic issues begin to misinterpret the objective of progressivism not as social reform, but as an immediate opposition to any proposal with so much as a whiff of what they think is capitalism. A surface level reading of the situation will motivate your reasoning: Brown + Money > Capitalism Bad >:( > Dorm Ugly!! Most shocking is to hear my ACABer friends cry over the displacement not removal, displacement of a police station and its parking lot. But understanding the actual side effects of housing construction will elicit support from those who have more than name only solidarity with the people with the least power in this situation. I watch people who decry the displacing effects of gentrification and rage at landlords on social media turn on a dime at the slightest mention of Big Bad Brown Corp. and vehemently oppose the construction of a building that would directly combat the phenomenon they despise. Whose financial interests do you stand behind when you oppose housing construction? Rich local landowners. Theyre with you on the Facebook picket line. Imagine mocking a (different) building that represents an attempt to h o u s e efficiently store s t u d e n t s property as dystopic at a school that hasnt built a place for its students to live in about three decades. If what it took to stop climate change and gentrification was for us to live in Platinum LEED glorified container ship crates, would you be able to stomach it? If you have concerns about the proposal because of overenrollment, ask yourself this: what attendance trend is this dorm specifically designed to address directly? Which should Brown take into more consideration? A) College Hill landlord financial interests and your aesthetic disapproval of a building that you haven seen, and unless youre a freshman will not be completed while you here and that you will likely never set foot in? Or B) the permanent creation of quality student housing with direct access to businesses on their bottom floor that eases the financial burden on graduate students and low income community members by removing hundreds of wealthy, elite, largely white students armed with their parents' money from the renting market? Ask yourself that question the next time you briskly walk past a homeless person on Thayer."""

Most of the people who make fun of others for selling out come from families where money has never been an issue. If youve never had to think about money because you were born wealthy, then maybe you have the luxury of not making life decisions based off of money. Its easy to not care about how much money you make when youve already enjoyed the benefit of having a lot of money for your entire life. Its also easy when you know that you have family wealth and connections as a safety net to fall back on. Thats not true for all of us.

I agree with everything you said about not generalizing, just because youre a legacy doesnt mean you didnt work hard, etc. Your feelings are totally valid BUT here is something you need to recognize: all of the things you used as examples of how hard you worked to get in here are so inherently privileged. Going to a school that offers AP classes? Or things you can compete in at a national level? Having time to be the president of multiple clubs because you didnt have to work to support your family? MULTIPLE internships??? All of those opportunities you had were (most likely) at least loosely tied to whatever success your mom had after graduating from brown. I dont fault you for taking advantage of them because you cant control the life youre born into so you should take advantage of whatever youve got, but you should also recognize that some people here didnt have any of those opportunities, and thats why a lot of non legacy students feel so strongly about admissions processes that favor legacies in any waylegacies (in general) already have such a huge advantage over non legacies, so why should they be given any more?"

Piazza private post is wonderful but I feel bad for the or super hardworking TAs who probably are spending a good chunk of their lives helping other students. Whoever is doing the course evaluation for Brown should include the average Piazza response time, the average TA hours sign me up wait time, and the percentage of students who signed up for TA Hours but did not get seen into course evaluation already. These are the problems that need to be solved. I grateful that the CS department is utilizing Piazza/SignMeUp but we probably can do better. What if we hire more professors/ more grad TAs? What if we pay TAs more so more people would apply? Yes Brown CS wants to commit to its quality in hiring for the students but at this point the ones paying the toll for the time the department takes to carefully respond to the increasing numbers of students are the students themselves.

1593,2020-02-23 12:04:00," When a worker does work, they generate more wealth for their employer than they are paid. If they did not, nobody would pay them to do that work. Market forces will drive their wage to be as low as possible. Because of this, over layers of employment, wealth is always funneled up. In this system, we expect those at the top to have obscenely more wealth than everyone at the bottom. The more people there are in a nation, the lower we expect wages to be, and the higher we expect the accumulated wealth of those at the top to be. This is quite obviously the case, in the USA. In some ways, this is good. It means people are working hard, and the economy is efficient. If those at the top are competent, they can placate the masses with all their excessive wealth. They can take whatever good fortune they had to end up at the top and fund whatever project or luxury they want, as long as everyone below them is happy enough with their lives that they don mind. But this is not the case in the US. Those at the top are overwhelmingly stupid, and abusive. Instead of trying to generate more wealth overall, they resort to stripping away anything they can from the most vulnerable people. They make living more expensive, working less rewarding, and education less accessible, because they would rather the wealth of an unhealthy population rather than the labor of a motivated powerful population. They look at climate change and choose a future of paying to mitigate its damages for a present of scavenging just a little more profit. They could have given everyone healthcare, invested in sustainable energy practices, and subsidized college so the laborers would be smart enough to generate even more wealth, and happy enough to let them live like kings. They could have placated the working class like they did the moderate middle class, who feel comfortable enough with their current lives that they resist any change. Instead, the working class is abused, the climate is hostile, and China is on track to economically surpassing a country that had a decade lead in technology, education, and infrastructure. The ruling class of the US is an embarrassment. They have proven unfit for the power they wield. Their power and hubris suppresses those who are better fit to organize and lead the country. This is why wealth redistribution is necessary. """

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like Mrs Paxson, you need to pay for those first. At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When the cashier took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, Paxson stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence, and then turned around and winked at me. I dont even think thats a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, Christina kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."""

He made fun of her family members, who I met and are wonderful people who are from a different upbringing and culture than him but definitely do not deserve his mockery. The problem is that while I want to talk to her about this, I also had a crush on her for a while. I never acted on those feelings in any way and don plan to while she still in a relationship because I do really value her friendship and wouldn want to ruin her relationship, but I still feel the need to talk about how problematic and hurtful her boyfriend is. I feel as though it would be really difficult to navigate this conversation because I do have feelings for her, but she deserves to be in a relationship with a person who supports her family, who accepts her friends and doesn alienate them, and who is just a nice person to compliment her kind personality even if it isn me, because I honestly don know if she interested in me like that, but I still want her to be in a happy, healthy relationship.

Hey @, check in with your government affairs people. There are not votes in the Senate to ban the private health insurance you got in your union negotiations, nor will there be after the election. You gonna be okay. Just because campaigns have goals and aspirations and both Warren and Sanders have proposed banning private insurance in their first terms doesn mean it going to happen immediately, and it doesn mean those aspirations are lies. It about having a fight that polarizes the electorate around a particular value in this case, people health care over profit, and it about showing a willingness to fight. That fight is unlikely to lead to % of the bill as written. The bottom line is that if you like Sanders or Warren and are a culinary worker being fearmongered by your union boss about your private health care, you should not be afraid you going to lose it, and vote your gut. Fellas: Do you support Bernie because: he is a realistic pragmatist who wont implement his flagship policy in his first term but electing him should show a willingness to fight? Yes We Can Try? Or You think the policies hes running on will actually get passed despite a Senate stuck in the Dem area (some of whom are named Manchin, Sinema, and Jones)? Is talking about the effects of a candidates proposed policies fearmongering because we shouldnt worry about outcomes; after all, the candidate wont actually implement their campaign promises? Or do working people have legitimate concerns about losing hard fought health care concessions from corporations to an untested centralized system that could be completely defunded by the next Republican Congress?

I had to pick one to ride. I don remember very much about the first few beasts, besides one horse who had a very clean sneeze that didn spray mucus or saliva even a little bit, and I thought ""!"""" But I have a clear memory of the last . The first three of those were either dragons or wyverns (I believe I called them dragons at the time, but I am fairly sure they were two legged, thus wyverns). The fourth to last beast was undead, mostly made of bones, yet tame, friendly if proud, and would have been easily ridden. Its sneeze was remarkable primarily for its very ability to sneeze (it lacking lungs, a throat, and a mouth). The third to last beast was a great red wyvern, and when it sneezed, flame burst forth from its scales over its entire body. "" is a truly remarkable sneeze!"""" I thought. The second to last beast was a golden wyvern, even larger than the last. When it sneezed, a column of flame burst from its mouth, and the room expanded to show me that the column didn decrease in intensity for meters! "" an astounding sneeze!"""" I though. What beast could top this?"""" The final beast was a fat brown narrow mouthed cartoon horse named Bob. At first, Bob refused to sneeze. After much cajoling on my part, he still refused to sneeze. Eventually, I put two fingers on his jaw to move it in a mimic of a sneeze, and the horse let out a quiet, non nonchalant "" chu."""" For some reason, it was immediately apparent to me that this had easily been the best sneeze of all, and that this was the beast I must ride. The horse and I exited through a window like our dorm windows, through the cm space between the bar and the sill, yet for some reason this was not a difficult task. I then realized the ridiculousness of the situation. I had exited via the window a room which had not been my own, and I was now hanging out of my dorm window, straddling a wingless, supposedly flying horse named Bob. I deduced that there were two possibilities . I had been given some sort of powerful hallucinogen, and I was now hanging out of my window, convinced that if I let go, an imaginary wingless horse would fly me to safety . I was dreaming If I were hallucinating and I let go, then I would surely die. As soon as the thought entered my mind that the horse was imaginary, it disappeared. I attempted to pull myself up on the bar, to see if I could climb bck in. I realized I could do so much more easily than I could in real life, and so concluded it must be a dream.

An article can be easily shut down if a higher up wants it to be, and thats what happened with the womens basketball article. The athletic department and the coach were made aware of the article and stopped it. It is not the BDHs fault. So, to make this quick: . Coach Sarah Behn is an extremely emotionally abusive woman. In her time here, more than women have quit the basketball team (pre, post, and mid season). . Shes racist (has made inappropriate comments about a woman on an opposing basketball team kneeling during the anthem as well as many other culturally inappropriate remarks) . She constantly violated FERPA (speaking to parents without the players consent) and shared information about players to their parents that were either inappropriate, false or defaming. . She emotionally manipulated players into sharing their personal life/struggles with her and then proceeded to use it against them in abusive ways (For example, had a sports psychologist join the team who did not keep the information that was shared with her confidential) . Continually shamed women about their weight by connecting their performance on the court with their weight, which caused some women to adopt unhealthy habits in hopes of losing weight and gain favor to play. . Shamed players for taking their schoolwork more seriously than basketball or not holding a basketball at a high enough pedestal. . Encouraged divisive chemistry between players on the team . In some cases, she was extremely disrespectful and rude to players' families that were not favored on the team. Overall, the program is an extremely toxic environment, and the athletic department thought it was okay to take away the voices of many women who were hurt. Thats what happened. """

2241,2020-02-10 05:02:00," This is about the coronavirus and Sinophobia. I have seen multiple posts on social media about university students' fear of Chinese folks or concerns over getting in touch with them. Even worse, a man showing the mud on his sole, pointing to it and saying ' to a Chinese student around Harvard. These trigger counterposts by ethnic Chinese, or more often in my circle, Chinese students feeling defensive and insecure about the racist or quasi racist surroundings they happened to be in. Two comments I want to make about the phenomenon. First, when people have concerns over specialised health issue such as the coronavirus, the best source of advice to address such apprehension, is a professional medical practitioner rather than a social media tunnel, no matter how easily accessible or emotionally comforting it is. You need to believe in science. You need to jump out of your own box and try to overcome your own sentiment and think, what that matter really is. Second, I strongly doubt the role elite universities play in the whole affair. At this moment of disease crisis, public apprehension and xenophobia, the university health service system should intervene more strongly and more professionally in providing reliable information about the virus and proper sanitary measures (such as careful washing of one own hands or more frequent use of % alcohol on door knobs, etc.), in sootheing the apprehension of its students, and in executing proper quarantine. Some prestigious universities or colleges in the New York state, according to some grumpy posts of quarantined Chinese students, are executing the quarantine measure in a more or less careless and performative way. Their staff would call to a student room in the dormitory and reprimand the person not to leave when the phone was not picked up last time. But people need to go to the restroom, they need to shower, and they need to get themselves necessary supplies that have not been sent directly to their rooms. Thus precautionary quarantine and observation need to be executed professionally and of course, as you mentioned in our interview, mental health service would do good. Thus, the university authority, I have to say, has not acted as professionally as one might have desired. Ethnic identity is a divisive issue in the US, just as the Cultural Revolution and are in China. But I am not presenting the solution from an ethnic perspective, which is quite popular among liberals nowadays. Surely I know some will dismiss those ideas as postmodern rubbish, though I do find them meaningful and useful. However, as a student of European history, I believe there are wiser ways, more universal ways than playing the ethnic card to address this xenophobia/(quasi )racism problem. That the moral lesson of Enlightenment philosphers: be alert at one own sentiment, esp. pride and prejudice; always have curiosity about and awe towards science; as for institutions handle social issues and policy making on campus in a professional way rather than fumbling like the French court on the eve of the revolution. This is why I really want to recommend Peter Gay magnus opus to readers of this post: Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation, vols. (pbk., New York, NY: W. W. Norton, ). Every sociey has its modern witch craze, so does the Chinese one. But here for the American society, looking at the intersection of coronavirus and race, if I am allowed to say a word than being censored, it goes as follows: if one gives way to fear rather than using such an occasion to learn a bit more about health and medicine, and worse, if one simply lets fear marry his or her own sense of ethnic superiority, this is even less so about '; this is really about forgetting the wisdom of his or her great great great grandfathers who opened a new page in European history and gave birth to this country."""

2487,2020-02-05 07:50:00," topics: kobe, sexual assault Before I start, I grew up in LA as a huge Lakers and Kobe fan. I think many people, especially non athletes and non Southern Californians, dont understand that Kobe was more than a basketball playerhe was someone everyone could look up to and learn something from. He was the greatest sports role model of all time in that he embodied all the principles and attributes of such. There is a reason why so many people have been devastated. Emotionally wrecked to the point where they cannot function. Basketball players across the nation, many of whom have grown up through unimaginable circumstances, are seen sobbing in the middle of games. Many have had to sit out for several days because they are not emotionally stable enough to play or practice. They just want to mourn. Even foreign athletes, including soccer and tennis players, have been seen heartbroken and paying their respects to Kobe. Reporters, coaches, talk show hosts, anyone who was able to have meaningful conversations with him have been in tears on national television. But on Dear Blueno, the majority of posts that I see are about Kobes sexual assault case, and the inability to understand why his death means so much more than those struggling in third world countries. Before delving into this, Kobe without a doubt made a severe mistake by putting the woman in an uncomfortable situation. And if this had happened during the Me Too movement, the consequences may have been different. His actions were unacceptable. However, if you do even the slightest bit of research you can see that the case was a lot less black and white. The victim chose not to testify in court, even though she did not receive any compensation/bribes from Kobe or his lawyers. I dont want to extrapolate on what this may mean, but there is a lot that can be implied from this. Also to be acknowledged is that the victim was a frequent consumer of hard drugs and had a few failed suicide attempts. This is not to denounce her credibility, but to shed light onto the fact that her mental state may have led to miscommunication. Aside from this, Kobe was relatively quick to apologize and expressed genuine regret for putting the victim and her family through such painful times. He believed the encounter was consensual. Ultimately, the case was settled privately. In such matters, we (including myself) are quick to side with the victim and sympathize with them. However, it isnt right to determine Kobes legacy based on a crime he was not charged for. While the case will forever be tied to his name, there are a multitude of reasons why his legacy is so great. As an year old coming straight out of high school, Kobe came straight for Michael Jordans unanimous title as the greatest basketball player of all time. Everyone thought he was crazy. But for years, he remained loyal to his Lakers while waking up daily at to practice times a day regardless of whether he was in season or off season. All that determination led to countless awards and he became the pride of Los Angeles. He was living proof that with hard work, anything was achievable. Off the court, he stressed the importance of paying things forward. He famously said that if he is remembered only as being a great basketball player, he has failed in life. Kobe stressed paying things forward to the new generation, and making things better for his children. He has advocated endlessly for womens rights, especially in the WNBA and NCAA womens basketball. In recent years, he has shown men around the world how to be a loving husband and a girl dad. As an intellectual who could fluently speak five plus languages, Kobe inspired minorities around the world to fall in love with basketball and connected with them through their dialect. He was a storyteller, winning an Oscar and writing a childrens book series. He was what every athlete should strive to be: a winner and a philanthropist. Kobe had so much more planned to accomplish, things that would benefit humanity and inspire the next generation. To me, and a large population of people especially from Southern California, Kobes death hits especially hard. Aside from family and close friends, he would be the last person we would want to lose. We feel like his life was cut too short, not to mention the lives of all the others on the plane including his daughter Gigi. This past week has been emotionally taxing for me and has been the most unproductive week of my life. You can say that Im weak for feeling that way, but I argue that it just shows how much Kobe meant for the people. I know its hard to truly know how others feel. Thats fine, but please try to be more understanding because a lot of people around you may be feeling the same way as I do. If Ive somehow motivated you to learn more about Kobe and his principles, Id suggest going to YouTube since endless numbers of people have been sharing touching stories about his kind heart and competitive nature. Kobe was as synonymous with Southern California as the sunshine. He touched every inch of it."""

2513,2020-02-03 08:01:00," Really agitated because I called Brown Health Services at around am to get medical advice from a nurse and all this Caucasian nurse did once she realized my last name was a Chinese one was say that everybody should be wearing masks everywhere since the US government refuses to take care of the Chinese problem and infected people are roaming around everywhere around us unchecked. In addition, she made fun of my voice and didn really listen to my symptoms. Let just say my symptoms were due to an allergic reaction to something but she said that what I was telling her could not be anything but pneumonia, probably associated with the Coronavirus, and that I needed to alert the hospital immediately, implying they should take precautions, and submit myself for evaluation. Meanwhile here I was sitting there thinking that one of the Brown Health Services nurses could offer up alternatives to Benadryl to help curb my allergies, since Benadryl makes me drowsy and non functional the next day. After that little... experience.. I ended up just biting the bullet and taking some Benadryl that finally allowed me to fall asleep. Lucky to announce that not only do I not have a cough, fever, or anything else indicative of pneumonia ( I had both bacterial and viral pneumonia before, so I think I would know my own body), but am now dreading going to Health Services for even a scratch because I legit afraid the nurse from last night is going to try to quarantine me. I had my fair share of racist comments throughout my life, and I know Chinese people are known to turn the other cheek when it comes to public conflict. But honestly, that the values that came from my parents' generation and I don intend to abide by them. I sick of the closeted xenophobia that some Americans mindlessly project, and that coming from me, an American myself. I felt that hard last night ( aka early this morning) like """" oh honey you and your kind are RUINING IT for everybody else. """" """" America first, but only the fully westernized Americans."""" Just because an epidemic happened to come out of a government negligence in communication and public sanitation, doesn mean that is a reflection of anything but another country grim state of affairs. It doesn give you a license to be a dick to Chinese people. If something broke out in France, would people with ties to France also be subject to this treatment? Don quite know the answer, but this should never happen, no matter where that something horrible originated from, regardless if the main people affected are white, black, Latinx, Native American, Asian, or any other race. I never felt so put into a box, and I can believe that out of all the places that this could happen, it would be on the Brown campus. And I grew up in a pretty racist town. I want Brown Health Services to be held accountable for their actions. """

They tell me to stop worrying as if I a competition they are trying to get rid of. On top of academic and resume building work, there is the social aspect which I also suck at. Just stepping into a ' event and realizing everybody else has their own circles and bubbles going with no space for me to awkwardly join in. Furthermore, the standards for females at brown is ridiculously high. People here are all gorgeous, smart, sociable, and radiates greatness. I tried to hit the gym and improve my fits but again, there is a voice telling me that I should be studying instead and just accept my place in society: a blur in the background.

When I protested, she told me to "" my own research"""" and "" my Sinophobia."""" What the hell happened? Our high school was in an extremely liberal coastal hometown. We were both deeply involved in social justice projects. That especially really breaks my heart. This person doesn have an excuse to be ignorant. She has all the freedoms Uighurs don, and access to an education that even most Americans couldn afford. I come from a family of refugees from two different ethnic genocides. I an American. They immigrated to the US for a reason they knew they would be safe, and they knew they could give their children a better life. We, their descendants, now have more power than almost anyone in society, and this is what we do with it? To see someone who used to stand up for marginalized communities actively participating in the TEXTBOOK DEFINITION of SYSTEMIC ERASURE by an Han supremacist state makes me depressed and numb. Since when is this being an ally? Does Islamophobia only matter when white people are the oppressors? Since when did being further left become more important than fighting for social justice? The transformation I seen in the past few year in friends from home is radical. Once, I marched with these people at the Women March, climate marches, against the travel ban and for #BlackLivesMatter. Now, they say that we need to dismantle capitalism completely, that feminism is """""", and they stan authoritarian, dictatorial regimes like China or Venezuela that are socialist in name only, just to own the libs. Please, friends and tankies. The lives and rights of millions of people across the globe should not be treated like pawns in your culture war, tossed aside when they become inconvenient to your narrative. The camps in Xinjiang should not be a partisan issue, especially for people with the privilege of your education. My great grandfather was taken to a camp, too. The absolute least you can do is acknowledge that it happened. And the next tiny step up from that is to promise that it won ever happen again."""

Women are being forced to marry (and are raped) by non Muslim men. Forced to drink and eat pork. Government is aware and spearheads this effort (check Wikileaks.) If you are Chinese, I feel as though you have a right to speak out against this. Silence, in the face of literal concentration camps, is a form of complicity. To my Chinese friends who continue to be nationalistic and not acknowledge this tragedy: you make me feel deeply unsafe on this campus.

I think it normal for most people to be able to befriend lots of people who don look like them, but at the end of the day find themselves most at ease with people who share an aspect of existence which those who look differently (less yellow, more white passing, more well off, perhapss) can really grasp. Just saying. Who hurt you and were they Asian """

While I will attest that the majority of bridge players are old, it is still super fun for young people. First of all, youll never see the same hand twice, unless you play .^ bridge hands. Second, each hand has like million different learning opportunities. Third, theres infinite things to learn about the game, and you never stop learning new things. Fourth, When you play competitively, you win non transferable, nonrefundable and non redeemable points called masterpoints, And even though Im a super frugal guy, I happily fork over money for the chance to win these points. But wait theres more. You dont need to pay to play, come to Browns Bridge club, where we have wonderful players who have super fun times playing a card game that is just as good shitfaced as sober, And that makes you Feel at times like a genius and it times like a doofus. The game challenges you more than anything else you will ever do. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk"""

3132,2020-01-24 02:23:00," topics: israel/palestine @ Registrations from who? Birthright is funded by a combination of the Israeli government and Jewish donors like Sheldon Anderson. You seem to misunderstand the concept of reparations. The idea is that the group or institution responsible should pay for the harm they done: hence why we talk about reparations for African Americans coming from the US Federal government (due to its long history of harming them). How would Birthright then be a form of reparations? The people directly paying for it monetarily are Jews, while the harm of it everyone is debating is felt by Palestinians (who are indeed victims of colonialism). If either cost of Birthright were paid for by Europeans, your argument would make a little sense, but instead it just harming other oppressed groups. No one asking Native Americans to foot the bill for reparations to African Americans. You seem instead to think that being part of an oppressed group makes it okay to do harm to others. Some of the original proposals for a Jewish state were in Native American lands or south Africa. Would it be justified to colonize and displace those peoples, just because of oppression Jews suffered all the way over in Europe? Not only does your post diminish the suffering of Palestinians and the ways in which Birthright is complicit in it, but you also twist the idea of reparations into something it not supposed to mean. There are people in this country fighting for reparations right now as a result of direct injustice against identities you don hold. Appropriating and misrepresenting that struggle just so you can divert attention from the suffering of Palestinains does no one good but yourself."""

3240,2020-01-23 02:27:00," topics: israel/palestine @ First of all, MLK died in when the Occupation was new, seemed temporary, and hadn yet become a fundamental part of the Israeli state. There had been no Likud governments, no invasions of Lebanon, no Intifadas (the first of which was directly inspired by King), and Israel had not just considered a constitutional amendment to legalize segregation. King never spoke on the issue of Palestinian refugees, so it kind of hard to reconstruct what his views would have been based on his few direct comments on the issue. But we can look to his values, as Michelle Alexander does in her NYT piece, "" to Break the Silence on Palestine"""" (which someone else linked to in the original thread): And so, if we are to honor Kings message and not merely the man, we must condemn Israels actions: unrelenting violations of international law, continued occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, home demolitions and land confiscations. We must cry out at the treatment of Palestinians at checkpoints, the routine searches of their homes and restrictions on their movements, and the severely limited access to decent housing, schools, food, hospitals and water that many of them face Of course, there will be those who say that we cant know for sure what King would do or think regarding Israel Palestine today. That is true. The evidence regarding Kings views on Israel is complicated and contradictory. Ultimately, King canceled a pilgrimage to Israel in after Israel captured the West Bank. During a phone call about the visit with his advisers, he said, I just think that if I go, the Arab world, and of course Africa and Asia for that matter, would interpret this as endorsing everything that Israel has done, and I do have questions of doubt. https://www.nytimes.com////opinion/sunday/martin luther king palestine israel.html Either way, we have seen what the Israeli government does to nonviolent activists like King: Mubarak Awad, founder of the Palestinian Centre for the Study of Nonviolence, was deported from his birthplace of Jerusalem, something not even George Wallace or Lester Maddox had the gall to attempt. Like Alexander, I am willing to bet that if King had lived to witness the First Intifadawhen nonviolent Palestinian protesters were beaten under Yitzhak Rabin order to "" their bones"" if he were alive today to see Palestinian protesters in Gaza be mowed down by snipers, he would not have condoned the perpetrators (as your quote about """""" suggests). It frustrating every MLK day to see white people try to reinvent King as some kind of black puppet conveniently condoning their own reactionary views, now that hes no longer alive to defend himself. King was a proud radical; he was hated by most white people as a radical; and he was killed just two weeks after that quote of yours for being a radical. If you actually want to honor his memory, you should start by reexamining some of your own views on justicelike why youre on the side against justice for Palestinians. """

I believe her. But not because she is a woman. I believe her because her testimony and the evidence presented for her case read, to me, as credible. In Warren case, however, the accusation and context are obviously and entirely different. Given Bernie stated positions and track record advocating for women candidates and issues concerning women, does it seem to make any sense at all that he would even entertain such an idea, that a woman couldn be president? And doesn that accusation fit Warren political agenda to win the primary she losing a little too snugly? And isn the timing (reviving an unconfirmed, alleged statement a year after it was made) three weeks out from the Iowa caucus, even the slightest bit suspicious to you?

If he is able to purchase better equipment, that is his right as an individual. How is Dracos superior purchasing ability qualitatively different from my superior Snitch catching ability? I guess it isnt, Ron said crossly. Harry laughed, cool and remote, like if a mountain were to laugh. Someday youll understand, Ron. Professor Snape stood at the front of the room, his beak like nose protruding over the silent classroom. There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class.

I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Harrys hand shot up. What is it, Potter? Snape asked, irritated. Whats the value of these potions on the open market? What? Why are you teaching children how to make these valuable products for ourselves at a schoolteachers salary instead of creating products to meet modern demand? You impertinent boy Conversely, whats to stop me from selling these potions myself after you teach us how to master them? I This is really more of a question for the Economics of Potion Making, I guess. What time are econ lessons here? We have no economics lessons in this school, you ridiculous boy. Harry Potter stood up bravely. We do now. Come with me if you want to learn about market forces! The students poured into the hallway after him. They had a leader at last.

Let us leave at once, to assist Hagrid in his noble enterprise of raising as many dragon eggs as he sees fit, in spite of our countrys unjust dragon trading restrictions. But its your parents, Harry, Ron said. Ron never really got it. Harry sighed. The fundamental standard for all relationships is the trader principle, Ron. I dont understand, Ron said. Of course you dont, said Harry affectionately. This principle holds that we should interact with people on the basis of the values we can trade with them values of all sorts, including common interests in art, sports or music, similar philosophical outlooks, political beliefs, sense of life, and more. Dead people have no value according to the trader principle. But they gave birth to y I made myself, Ron, Harry said firmly. Give me your wand, boy, Voldemort hissed. I cannot do that. This wand represents my wealth, which is itself a tangible result of my achievements. Wealth is the product of mans capacity to think, Harry said bravely. Voldemort gasped. There is a level of cowardice lower than that of the conformist: the fashionable non conformist. Voldemort began to melt. Harry lit a cigarette, because he was the master of fire. The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities. The minimum wage is a tax on the successful. The market will naturally dictate the minimum wage without the government stepping in to determine arbitrary limits. Voldemort howled. Im going to sell copies of my wand at an enormous markup, Harry said, and you can buy one like everyone else. Voldemort had been defeated. He hated us for our freedom, Ron said. No, Ron, Harry said.

Ron looked out over the long, long skies of Hogwarts and dreamt of love and romance and the soft touch of woman. He had learned that a man can only be an economist for so long before he longs to be a man again and for music and dancing and girls. Harry began to explain how using game theory he had decided that the Patel twins would make the optimal dates to the Yule Ball and Ron sighed silently. But Harry needed him.

3420,2020-01-18 01:21:00," On the topic of veganism, I feel as if the messaging should be made a bit more accessible to the general meat eating public. In my view, people have to really try to fit into the label of vegan or vegetarian and compel themselves to stick to those diets strictly when it might be more sustainable in the long run to try being % vegetarian or pescatarian for a while and gradually pushing yourself when you feel as if you can sustain going further. I suggest setting rules when youd like to improve your habits, such as Ill choose vegetarian options when Im eating at dining halls or making food for myself, but if Im going out to eat or if someone makes me food Im allowed to eat some meat. Inconvenience can be a big hurdle when it comes to limiting your intake of animal products (e.g. your friends bring you to a restaurant where they put meat or butter in everything except the fries), so dont be discouraged if you choose to eat something you normally wouldnt allow yourself too. The main thing is making gradual improvements in a way that is easy enough for you to sustain in the future. That means ensuring you keep up the diet in a healthy way by eating the right foods and supplementing what youre not getting (highly recommend that anyone whos going vegetarian/vegan use the app Cronometer to plug in their foods for a few days and see what nutrients they might be missing; common deficiencies are , iron, omega , folate) Eating less meat (especially beef) is probably the single best way to reduce your environmental impact. Yes, our environmental concerns are mainly because of corporations but I do believe that it is worth it to make the effort. When enough people opt out of or reduce consumption of meat and advocate for plant based alternatives, then the demand begins to shift more towards those alternatives. That causes restaurants to add vegetarian options, because they know if theres a vegetarian friend in a group, they could lose multiple customers by not being a viable option for that group. That causes dining halls to provide vegan options (luckily at Brown they provide enough to where you can eat completely vegan at the dining halls for a year and not go insane). Supermarkets begin stocking more options for plant eaters (thats why theres so many plant milks and fake meats available now). This, in turn, makes it more accessible for others to choose differently. I understand that diets that limit consumption of animal products arent accessible to everybody. However, Id like to urge you all to try to make small changes wherever possible and push yourself to eat better. You know that animal agriculture in the US is cruel and highly taxing to the environment, and if you dont I recommend you educate yourself on the topic (watch Kurt Geszagts video on meat or Cowspiracy or one of the many other films/videos). Environmental and political advocacy are the most important things you should be taking up in response to the current climate crisis, but making personal choices that support the mission alongside those efforts are an admirable part of gradually transforming our society into one thats more sustainable in the future. Plus, most of you who havent made an effort would probably see health improvements in switching from what youre eating now to less red meat and more fish and vegetables. For my fellow athletes, if Clarence Kennedy can clean and jerk over lbs and do all the other crazy shit he does on a plant based diet, Im sure youll function fine on a few more plants. Make the change (gradually if youre new), and if you agree with whats been said here, encourage your meat eating friends to make the change too. In my opinion, its been easy and convenient to be vegetarian here and Ive made an effort to improve so that in due time Ill be granted my vegan powers. Thank you for those who got to the bottom of this long ass post I decided to write at midnight. Sincerely, A bad vegan"""

I been seeing a psychologist off campus for a few months and I think it would be helpful to talk to a psychiatrist about whether it would be helpful for me to get on medication as well. It seems like the three best options are either to go through health services, talk to a psychiatrist at CAPS, or find an off campus psychiatrist that takes the Brown health insurance. Right now I leaning towards the latter option because I more comfortable talking about my issues with people who aren affiliated with Brown. However, it also seems like the former two would probably be easier/faster options and also wouldn require a co pay, so I not sure what would be best."
3450,2020-01-18 01:16:00," @: Im not gonna answer the stuff about the bread of christ and what not, people already did that. In regards to the Catholic Church, youre absolutely right to say that theyve treated people who arent straight inhumanely (as well as other groups too). They have a long history of hypocrisy and prejudice and anyone who doesnt believe that is lying to themselves. But while the Vatican and many other Catholics are jerks especially those with a sufficient amount of power and an insufficient amount of intelligence I like to believe not all of them are. The Brown Catholic Community is big about being tolerant and kind to one another in my experience (like how whenever those docuhey Christians show up and the BRCC have a stand across from it that offers free coffee to all and says something along the usual lines of God loves all people). Im Catholic because my sister died as a stillborn, and being one gives me a sense of security and closure that she can safe in heaven (even if its erroneous). I also choose to ignore the Vatican and follow it my own way but just trying to be a decent person. So I hope you can read this OP and understand that while Catholicism certainly needs change, people are trying to do it."""

3550,2020-01-16 12:12:00," I agree with that previous DB post that talked about how single sex housing is inherently close minded. Someone in defense of single sex housing said that a main reason is if someone was sexually assaulted by the opposite sex they should be able to choose housing where they don need to be in the bathroom with the opposite sex. However, that an EXTREMELY heteronormative opinion because you assuming that most sexual assaults are heterosexual. What about the number of homosexual men that get sexually assaulted by other homosexual men?? Additionally, just because you been assaulted by someone of the opposite sex doesn mean that hiding from the opposite sex for the rest of your life will be a solution. Let just say I was once robbed by a black person, should I be allowed to request that I don have to live in a dorm with black people since I experienced a trauma from a black person?? I think that would be a disgusting thing to ask, thus I still don understand why single sex housing is something we should support."

3558,2020-01-16 12:12:00," CW: politics Quentin Hart, the black mayor of Iowa most racially diverse city, is backing Pete Buttigieg for president, giving the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor a rare boost from a minority leader as he struggles to attract voters of color. Hart told The Associated Press he was supporting Buttigieg in part for what he called the Democrat effort to address racial economic disparity in South Bend. Like Waterloo, which Hart represents, South Bend is a once thriving Midwestern city with a higher than average unemployment rate and a history of racial discord. The Buttigieg campaign hopes Hart endorsement will help not only inoculate the year old Buttigieg from the stubborn notion that he cannot win black support but also potentially resonate beyond majority white Iowa, as Buttigieg winds his way through the Democratic primary campaign. He taken an industrial place like South Bend, Indiana, which is kind of similar to the story of Waterloo, Iowa, where a lot of people had given up on that community, and made great strides to turning it around, Hart said of Buttigieg. The endorsement comes three weeks before Iowa first in the nation caucuses. Polls show Buttigieg, who served two terms as mayor from to early this year, in a tightly grouped pack at the top, along with former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Waterloo, a city of about , residents, has a black population of %, less than South Bend roughly %. Just like in South Bend and Waterloo, were placed in situations where it seems like were responsible to fix generations of decline, to fix generational and systemic racism or problems that weve had, said Hart, who is the first black mayor of Waterloo and is in his third term. The campaign hopes that Hart, who has also dealt with racial unrest involving policing in his city, can inspire others to follow him, especially in subsequent nominating contests with greater racial diversity, such as the Feb. South Carolina primary. I think I can play a role moving forward with the campaign,"""" Hart said. "" the hope of Mayor Pete as well."""

3580,2020-01-13 10:15:00," Nuclear power is not the secret solution to climate change that only unpopular because of media fueled paranoia about reactor meltdowns. Most of us who don support expanding nuclear couldn care less about the physical dangers posed by nuclear power plants, as it clear that related deaths are extremely rare. However, from a purely economic standpoint nuclear is vastly inferior to both wind and solar. Some data on costs: (for reference, LCOE is the levelized cost of energy and denotes the "" constant price at which electricity must be sold in order to break even over the lifetime of the project"""") https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott////clean energy will continue to hit dirty power as costs continue to fall/# LCOE for onshore wind is $. per kWh LCOE for offshore wind is $. per kWh, and Denmark and the Netherlands are building wind farms that are expected to achieve prices of $. to $. per kWh LCOE for solar PV is $. kWh, and Brazil, India, Mexico and Texas already have solar farms with prices between $. and $. per kWh https://www.world nuclear.org/information library/economic aspects/economics of nuclear power.aspx LCOE for onshore wind is $. per kWh LCOE for solar PV is $. per kWh LCOE for nuclear is $. per kWh https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf Cost of energy farms/plants entering service in : LCOE of onshore wind: average $. per kWh, lowest is . per kWh LCOE of solar PV: on average $. per kWh, lowest is $. per kWh LCOE of nuclear: on average $. per kWH, lowest is $. per kWh https://www.lazard.com/perspective// The cost of onshore wind has fallen about % over the last decade The cost of solar PV has fallen about % over the last decade https://www.reuters.com/article/us energy nuclearpower/nuclear energy too slow too expensive to save climate report The cost of nuclear has increased about % over the last decade, the only energy source to have risen in price. The data overwhelmingly points to onshore wind and solar being cheaper than nuclear, with or without subsidies, and the discrepancy between the prices will only increase over time as nuclear gets more expensive and wind/solar prices fall. In addition, the primary source of new energy farms/plants are private firms, and given the much longer return on capital period for nuclear compared to solar and wind, and coupled with decreasing electricity costs, investors are much more likely to invest in lower capital, quicker return on investment options like wind and solar; indeed, the market data reflects this. What this means is that any plan to fight climate change that is centered around nuclear power is doomed to fail, given increasing costs, lack of private interest, and long implementation periods. I not asking for an immediate decommissioning of all existing nuclear power plants, but there is little reason to center climate plans around nuclear or build new plants, especially in countries that already have them."""

3626,2020-01-13 10:10:00," Last night I went on a Tinder date for the first time since I ended a LTR that had become abusive. Tinder guy seemed intelligent, attractive, employed... all the usual things I look for in a partner. We met at the bar and ordered drinks. As the conversation developed, I could sense he had a really strange attitude. It was a combination of an unearned sense of superiority, unnecessary oppositional behavior, and inexplicable misdirected hostility, all poorly concealed under a thin veil of self serving liberalism. My spidey senses were tingling so I asked, "" just curious, what was your major in university?"""" But I already knew the answer. """""" he said, proudly. "", cool..."""" I said, rolling my eyes, flooded with memories of past Tinder escapades from my late teens and early . In my experience, men who study philosophy are just... the worst people. Women who study philosophy are fine, because they just want to read and learn and have cool discussions. Whereas men who have studied philosophy seek to dominate. They are so convinced of their own genius that they constantly interrupt or talk over me. They will go on and on mansplaining a basic concept I already familiar with. They boring. They don actually listen to what I have to say and instead wait for me to stop talking (or they don bother and just interrupt) so they they can parrot some canned talking point they saw on Reddit. If I expess any kind of opinion, they immediately play "" advocate"""" and argue against literally any position I take, not because they actually believe it, but because they just love the sound of their own voice. To them, every conversation has """""" and """""", and no matter how objectively, factually, demonstrably wrong they are, they will still argue until they are blue in the face. If they sense they are """""" a """""" (aka a normal conversation) they often resort to cheap derailing tactics, logical fallacies, and """""" Now, I graduated with honors from a prestigious university. I no dummy. I done my fair share of reading. I can discuss Hegel, Heidegger, and Sartre just as good if not better than most male self described philosophers. Frankly, I never met a male philosophy student who wasn a contrarian, arrogant, narcissist, and misogynist. (Fun fact: many of the gReAt philosophers thought women were like children at best, and evil and sinister at worst). It almost like the only reason these dudes studied philosophy was to learn the vocabulary and argumentation needed to justify and reinforce their distorted attitudes about themselves, the world, and women. Unfortunately, because I chose to study liberal arts, I been surrounded by such men in school, work, and friend circles. I even been on dates with some of them. Fortunately, my education has equipped me with the vocabulary, argumentation, critical thinking skills, and mental fortitude needed to defeat and avoid them. Last night I finished my one drink as quickly as possible and slammed it on the table. Without even waiting for him to finish whatever dull talking point he was trying to make, I stood up abruptly, said "" for the drink"""" and left. He texted me later asking what happened. When I didn reply within minutes, he texted me again insulting me and saying I STOLE from him because I didn pay for my drink. So, I blocked him. In conclusion: never date a guy who studied philosophy. Huge red flag. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Edit: I would also like to add libertarians to the "" not date"""" list. They are basically sociopaths dressing up their distorted morals as a political philosophy."""

Heinz was young at the time, but in his twenty four years of life he had committed more atrocities than many modern serial killers. The man was abhorrent, through and through. Yet, during one of his patrols, he overheard hitler say something so detestable, so horrific, that even Heinz shuddered at the thought. While the book was written in English, the translated German was frighteningly clear. A picture of the original letter was supplied next to the text; the writing was scribbled and shaky, as if Heinz had been trembling while he was writing. While Im glad he had the courage to write down Hitlers awful musings, it was still hard to read.

The grading structure was wack: pretty much just the two exams (midterm and final), along with a small presentation component . The prof wasnt very helpful in office hours; I went several times and he assumed a lot of knowledge about international law and made me scared to ask questions . Readings: the readings consisted of legal case briefings, so a lot of legal jargon with very little support to navigate it (see point ) . Midterm: we had a hour essay based midterm on canvas. Then the day before coming back from spring break, the prof emailed us telling us he was going to count the midterm as a learning experience and not grade it . When he returned comments on the midterm, they were (at least in my experience) pretty condescending; he told many of us to go to the Writing Center and that we needed to work on our legal writing, without providing any feedback/ opportunities to actually develop those skills (b/c there were no assignments outside of the midterm and final) .

In my cupboard I store several bag of bean, to make soft and to bake on some days, to have a bit of baked bean on my dinner. Or, heck, a lunch too some days. But on the Monday I find this girlfriend baked all the beans. I say "" do you bake my beans"""", and she say something as "" bakes them good to save time, so I bakes them all now."""" I am astonished and full of dissmay. I say "" canfr not eat all the beans"""", she say she is froze many of the beans so as we can unfrozen the on a later day and eat some at a time. But, if a bean is froze and unfrozed, the very good and very nice flavor of bean is gone far. A bean is best if baked fresh as a Sunday Pie. Not to be froze and unfroze! I told my girfriend I am so sad of this, as to my opinion the baking of the beans and to freeze them has ruin all my beans. She say I am "" haywire"""" by my enragement and sad manners. But I hates what she did to my beans. On the days before Monday I thought "" we marry the girlfriend? Well it might be so."""" But now I am so sad she baked them beans. I am consider to end our relations and not be the boyfriend and girlfriend any more. But, is my idea wrong? Could my girlfriend make promise to not bake the beans? I do not know what doing to do and how to feel forgiving on her. Oh yes TL;DR So what I say is my girlfriend bakes all the beans in my house and freeze many of them, so as now most my beans is ruined and has no good flavors.

3824,2020-01-08 01:36:00," topics: wwiii/iran Please read! "" just some food for thought on everyone cheering for the death of the bad guy: To begin, I need to clarify that being anti war is not being anti America (quite the contrary). No doubt, US media whether CNN, FOX, or MSNBC are quite polarized when it comes to national politics. Yet, foreign policy will not change across these platforms. Why? Both political parties have contributed to these regime change wars for decades across the world. Both liberals and conservatives need to stop jumping on the war bandwagons depending on the current president. Yes, you can be liberal and still disagree with Obamas foreign policy. Yes, you can be conservative and disagree with Trumps foreign policy. To genuinely debate the assassination of Soleimani or any conflict at that matter, READ THE HISTORY. First off, understand the Shia and Sunni conflict in Islam. This allows you to understand the political divide of most nations in the Middle East. For example, Iran (a Shia majority country) is in constant conflict with Saudi Arabia (a Sunni majority country). In , The CIA led a coup d etat to overthrow the democratically elected Shah Mohammad Mosaddegh to replace him with his son, Shah Reza Pahlavi. The United States set up this puppet regime in order to have control of the countrys oil. The new Shah was forced to westernize Iran at an alarming rate, completely ignoring the Shia traditions of the country. In , the Islamic Revolution arose and set up the current government. In , the USA supported Saddam Husseins troops (yes, the USA supported Saddam Hussein, but media tries to erase that part of history) against Iran. This adds to Irans hate of American policy. Fast forward fo September , . Extremists flew into the World Trade Center. Not a single one of those extremists were from Iran. On the contrary, of the were from SAUDI ARABIA (OUR ALLY) which promotes Wahhabism, the extremist ideology of ISIS and Al Qaeda. Fast forward a couple of years, The USA goes to war with Saddam Hussein with fear of weapons of mass destruction! These were never found and led to the death of million Iraqis and thousands of American soldiers. USA now had access to the countrys riches and natural resources. Yet, this led to the growth of Irans influence in Iraq. The USA has set up an almost complete economic embargo on Iran and crippled the country. In , the USA aids in the war against Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, Irans strongest ally in the region, increasing tensions with the country. The USA aids and trains rebel groups that eventually form into ISIS and other terrorist groups that sweep the regions of Iraq and Syria. Irans Soleimani steps into to prevent the fall of the Syrian government and aids in the defeat of many of these rebel groups. Trumps claim that Soleimani was planning an imminent attack on Americans comes from the same American intelligence community that stated Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The claim that Soleimani killed American lives is also a little grey. He is by no means innocent and was in charge of the IRGC that aided in the Iraqi resistance against America back in that led to the deaths of Americans. Yet, go back into history and ask the question WHY WERE WE ILLEGALLY IN IRAQ!? WHICH KILLED MILLION IRAQIS Once again, this shows the American Foreign policy double standard. We need to grasp the concept that America, and any country in the world at that matter, is not looking to promote freedom, democracy, and destroy oppressors. It is all a power grab and that is politics. America will attack a certain country to increase their influence in the region and control its natural resources under the mask of FREEDOM! And we unfortunately believe it. The USA stands in strong support of Saudi Arabia, a country which has strong and clear links to Al Qaeda and is the birthplace of ISIS ideology. Saudi Arabia is responsible for the death of thousands of Americans, and we ignore these facts because they buy billions of dollars worth of weaponry. Saudi Arabia till this day has been known to perform public beheadings and hangings. America supports Israel that has established a + year apartheid on Palestinian people. Several countries in Africa are run by dictators that no one cares about because these countries dont offer natural resources or a geopolitical location in the world. Dont be afraid to question why governments do what they do. You are not a conspirator or an anarchist. You are an American citizen that is concerned for the lives of Marines that should not be fighting a pointless war. You are also a human and should understand these wars result in the death of millions of civilians in the Middle East that media will call collateral damage."""

3831,2020-01-08 01:36:00," @Rick Bungiro I find it a little concerning that you let a DB post get to you enough to actually respond to it. As in, a Brown faculty member actually decided to publicly respond to a student who posted anonymously complaining about grades. However unprofessional I personally believe this is (maybe Im out of line), I think it was very wrong of you to post the percentage of students who received a certain grade in your course. To explicitly state for the world to see how many students specifically did not either receive a C or NC in your course was rude, inconsiderate, and frankly elitist. You are essentially shaming anyone who didnt do as well as % of the students, while failing to consider any personal issues, student drops, and other academic reasons that may have caused such a grade. I did not take your course this semester (not for I plan to), but I am personally always happy in a sense to receive a C. This is because even though Id like to do better it reminds me that I can still succeed at an ivy league institution, and consider any C to be better than an NC.

However if we use subjective lens we can see that peer relations have a connection based on commonality whether the shared interests are of materials or of ideals towards life such as art, media etc. If we pan the objective side, as reality is both subjective and objective though operates mostly within frames of objectivity, then we conclude that the obvious necessity of ones counselor to reflect their race is highly crucial to therapy sessions.. Though the race of the therapist may be less a variable impedance to caucasians, there persists a need for a psychologists to ethnically reflect the individual patients as there may be intersectional familiarity of experiences, as we live in a racialize society . A psychiatrist is trained knowing how a behavior causes another behavior, not clarity of the brains functions. Schoolchildren look up to their teachers, they are mentors and on the spot therapists,, then yes responses and connections and improvements to character may be more readily assessable if the teacher ethnically reflects the students. The article take good induction of ethnographic research, though Ms. Lee doesnt correlate the research to a precise conclusion. I wonder how long the contemplation was before giving a shot at the article.. To conclude I like to put simply, OF COURSE it matters."

Note this may be trigger if you had similar experiences: Pareidolia. The jellyfish on the wall reminds you of the figures you spotted in clouds years ago. Like every other curious child, youd lie on the grass pointing at passing shapes. There were no big words, deep thoughts, or tricky meanings. It was just you and your unicorn friends in the sky. Yesterday your mind may have allowed chasing fascinations, but today your mind had no room for anything but reality. The jellyfish escape only districted you from one slow movement. You shutter and your eyes clench shut. The jellyfish is gone but at least the darkness behind your frail eyelids disconnects one of your senses from reality. As you embrace this darkness, a hand touches your empty stomach. Cold fingertips push deeper into your skin. As you lose the ability to breathe, the pressure increases. Alarms, sirens, and screams echo through your mind. And every fiber of your body needs to make it stop. Yet you lie motionless. Mental dissociation seems the most promising escape.

Buttigieg worked tracking down terrorist funding sources while in Afghanistan. Thats relevant to me. Theres a major difference between voting Yes or No on war and flying home for the weekend and actually seeing the ramifications of war in real life. I think if Obama spent seven months in the Middle East serving, he might not have been so trigger happy with drone warfare.

3869,2020-01-05 10:28:00," To whoever wrote : I dont know who you are, but your message really resonated with me because Im on the other side of your situation. I had a friend who treated me and many of their other close friends badly due to their own personal issues and lack of experience with relationships, and to cut a long story short, we arent on speaking terms anymore even though we were inseparable for years. It sucks to lose someone like that, no matter whose fault it is. I dont know if this advice applies to your situation, but if you really want to fix things the first step is usually to take a long hard look in the mirror. You may feel like youre causing other people pain due to a lack in social intelligence, but more often than not its a lack of self awareness that causes people to inappropriately handle difficult social situations. If youre not aware of your own tendencies, its really hard to empathise with others in a meaningful way and its really easy to get caught up in your own confusion and forget that everyone else has feelings too. Regardless, trying to force yourself to forget something causing you constant pain isnt healthyas much as it sucks, sometimes the only sustainable solution is to face your problems directly. It seems like youre already starting to do that, which is a great first step. As far as this person is concerned, if they have told you they dont want you to contact them you absolutely need to respect that. If that isnt the case and you feel that you still owe them an apology, make it an honest one. Dont make excusesjust explain specifically what you did wrong and how it was hurtful, that you regret your actions and the pain you caused, and that youre taking specific concrete steps to do better. Remember that this person is never under any obligation to forgive you or take you back into their life, even if you do everything right from now on. That being said, a heartfelt apology could help you both start a new chapter, or at least find closure. Given that I dont know your situation, please take all this with a grain of salt and disregard it entirely if it doesnt apply to you. I just wanted to let you know that youre not alone and you will get past this, one way or another. Hang in there."""

The liquid coming out from squirting seems to consistently differ from what ones pee should be like (e.g., if you were dehydrated, the squirt liquid is still clear, not yellow). So there are clearly differences between this and pee, but theres no concrete stance on whether or not theyre completely separable, so it shouldnt be presented as such.

Or keep it on the down low if someone reports you for dating your student, how would the school know that you werent just dating beforehand, which the commenters seem to think is fine? LOLOL... To the frequent commenters really being so black and white about dating a TA: . There is no reason why dating a TA versus being a close friend would jeopardize the ability to be a TA. AKA friends will pressure you just as much as an SO for grades and unfair advantages. Its up to the TA to have good morals and be fair, and let the proper people know about ANY relationship, romantic or otherwise, prior to the semester so as to mitigate bias. . If you actually know someone well beforehand, even if youre not yet dating, the power dynamics of being someone elses TA wont pressure the student into accepting the relationship or whatever. If you are pursuing a student you just met or are just getting close to during this semester though, then hold off. . If you want to cry about school rules, stop being hypocritical and be upset that people dating their SOs before the semester can also enter into a TA student relationship. After all, the rules say that NO TA CAN DATE A STUDENT IN THE CLASS. You dont have to follow every rule exactly as written and theres a lot more gray area than youre making it seem. Both me and my SO have been each others TAs before even though we started dating before that and most of the time, we didnt even remember that this was the case. If two people are on the verge of dating, it doesnt fucking matter if one of them is a TA and the other is a student. Life is too short to be dictated by fake ass rules some administrators wrote up. To all the people who are on the verge of dating, but one is about to be a TA, just fucking DO IT and stop posting bait just to get the same couple of people saying the same thing. I feel like its bait at this point, just like the posts about squirting.

When I proudly get home at PM, I usually look at the mirror and masturbate to my reflection to commend myself on another successful day of exerting my alpha male influence and saving the Asian race from racist and misogynistic colonizers who are stealing my women, I then down bottles of dinner soju and collapse onto my bed, ready to start another day with a massive hangover.

4118,2019-12-27 09:41:00," This isn a story for the faint hearted or easily triggered. If it offends you, I not sorry, you need to just grow a damn spine. Yesterday I walked into Starbucks (by accident, I was all out of my usual Death Wish). I waited in line and was immediately noticed by all the beta nu males because of the "" Love Guns and Killing"""" Grunt Style t shirt I wear everywhere because I like making people uncomfortable and reminding them that I a veteran. The hot barista (who wore too much make up and was probably an e thot) also noticed me and was probably impressed when I ordered a black coffee with a shot of espresso, none of that gay foo foo shit that hipsters with scarves like to drink. I was waiting for my masculine coffee when I noticed the TV above the lounge area playing a commercial for """""" on the CNN channel. I immediately demanded that they change the channel to either ESPN or Fox News. Theres no reason for anyone to watch the Commie News Network. Nobody really listened to me; I tried making eye contact with the hot barista but she was just studiously avoiding looking at me. I figured that maybe my "" Time is Fun Time, I Have Killed People Please Notice Me"""" shirt wasn working so I took out my dog tags and let them angrily clink together as I started shouting, "" off this goddamn liberal propaganda and turn on some fucking Duck Dynasty!"""" That was when I heard a voice from behind me say "", friend, why so angry during the holidays?"""" I turned around to see Mister Mistoffelees the magic cat staring at me from the TV screen. I could see his weird looking, too human lips and his whiskers smushing a little against the glass. "" you got some festive spirit in you,"""" the cat abomination continued. "" Christmas,"""" I said, immediately drawing my . ACP, which I open carry to trigger liberals. "" "" holidays."""" Ever notice how it ok to say "" Hannukah"""" and "" Radaman"""" but not "" Christmas?"""""""" Mistoffelees giggled, and the CGI meant to make his nose look more like a cats went fucking crazy. Nothing wrong with a little tolerance. Tolerance is how we got /, I replied, raising my gun. Mistoffelees giggled again, then screamed, Ia! Ia! Nariboath ruk shuul! and pressed his face harder against the glass. Suddenly his whiskers and his entire head were out of the television, and then his shoulders. I squeezed the trigger, putting a round through the television, but it was too late, he hit the ground with a wet smack, and I realized that it wasnt a cat, or a man, or anything at all, just a formless no thing in the guise of a furry, a hideous servitor of dread Nariboath, the devourer of Neo Babylon and Grand Consumer of the Etruton Host. I fired again, but there were already more no things squeezing through the glass, flopping onto the ground, shivering and laughing and screaming. I jumped back up onto the counter, sending some beta cucks soy mocha frappe cappuccino with extra cum froth flying to the ground. The hot barista who had noticed me open carrying and been turned on by my display of masculinity screamed in a way specifically designed to excite my male urge to protect in order to procreate, but by remembering the lessons of the philosophers Stefan Molyneux and Jordan Petersen, I prevented myself from being ensnared by her siren call. Men go their own way, I said masculinly, before backflipping behind the counter for cover as a howling abomination wearing the face of Rum Tum Tugger came shrieking across the caf toward me. I had clearly triggered the extradimensional horrors with my flagrant disregard for liberal cultural norms in favor of Western chauvinism and Christian supremacy. They attempted to virtue signal at me by absorbing the hot barista (who honestly wasnt that hot, she was wearing makeup designed to elicit a sexual response, not unlike a lobster) and the other patrons into a seething mass of flesh that writhed with arcane energies, melting together and then pulling apart like wet clay, the sound of peeling flesh drowned only by the screams of those damned who yet did not die. Youre just virtue signaling, I screamed as I emptied the magazine to no avail. Its ok to be a white male! Duck Dynasty, motherfuckers! I reloaded and shot myself in the dick to prove how masculine and powerful and not gay I am. This was, without a doubt, the worst experience Ive ever had. Starbucks may have gotten some of my money this time, but itll never happen again. The fact that they think its acceptable to discriminate against combat veterans, like myself, simply because were god fearing, law abiding conservatives who support Trump is beyond me. I hope youll all join me in #BoycottingStarbucks, and demanding to know if allowing extra dimensional cat demons to harass their patrons is standard practice or just something the owner of the local franchise is responsible for."""

If I wanted to a textbook"" I wouldn f ing take Orgo at Brown I would read the textbook and learn it myself (which is basically what had to be done anyway). What the point of saying learn how to read a textbook? That argument is idiotic; students take classes to learn the material not to be told to read the textbook and learn it themselves. People have legitimate criticism of the class and while the Piazza post came off as somewhat rude I sure it came from a place of frustration. The Prof asked TopHat questions on Yom Kippur and the day before Thanksgiving, was unresponsive via email and on piazza, and misrepresented the material that was going to be tested, to only name a few things that I found a little ridiculous. It frustrating to deal with this a whole semester in addition to teaching yourself all or most of the material in a class that is already hard enough on its own. Congratulations if you such a genius that you can succeed in these conditions but most people can, and to make these rude generalizations and comments, especially saying that they won succeed in med school, is counterproductive and ignorant."

But, what I have seen are many professors trying SO hard to make the class accessible, engaging, and interesting to the students and being met with vitriol and hate. The complaints I understand are coming from a place of frustration, but refusing to filter that and look at the professor side and believing you are entitled to a class that is catering to your every need is insane. Bassu assignment was an extra credit assignment that was not required. It crazy people were so mad at him for releasing an optional assignment that could only help their grade. Even annual complaints about Phys and Chem and orgo especially on piazza is insane. You do realize these professors are trying to teach mostly students who won major in that department and are only taking that class as a requirement? So they putting in effort to teach these large classes of students who only take it for a grade and have no interest in the material. The professors genuinely wish the students were focused on the material more, instead of the grade, which most premed students due.

I should also note that there aren many black people where she lives and any black presence at all has only started to grow during the past few years. How do I get her to stop saying this word? I feel like I coming from a place of privilege as I get to leave our country and occasionally come back and tell her the ~appropriate~ way to treat US media.

4363,2019-12-18 12:38:00," topics: circumcision: Whats the general view on circumcision? Im circumcised but wish I never had been. Its a nonconsensual form of genital mutilation that causes very young children unnecessary pain. It leads (again, needlessly) to the possibility of infection, hemorrhage, and other potential medical complications. It has negatively affected my ability to derive pleasure from the revolutionary act of queer lovemaking. I understand that circumcised penises stand less chance of becoming infected and that the anatomy of the foreskin can trap other fluids and assist the spread of HIV, but with proper hygiene education these issues are preventable and still are not self contained justifications for circumcision. Foremost for me, though, is the issue of bodily autonomy. I had no choice in this process and would never have chosen it for myself. (Methods for foreskin restoration do exist, but they take years and are a large inconvenience to the person undergoing them. No one should feel forced to undergo this process, and it is a process exclusionary to people without the financial means to purchase the equipment and/or seek medical advice, and is exclusionary to working people who dont have the time to sit through hours of treatment.) (I also recognize that circumcision is for some people a religious requirement, but in mine and many other peoples cases, it was notit is simply a societal norm that is pushed onto young children by parents who have not considered the ramifications of the operation and their place of privilege in deciding it be done for their child. I do want to push the envelope here and ask to what extent we will not speak out against socially enforced practiceswhich includes religious practiceswhich are damaging to a human body. Do a parents devoutly held religious beliefs trump the autonomy of their child, whose own religious beliefs they can influence but never ultimately decide?)

I was under the assumption it wasnt really up for debate that at some point a fetus becomes developed enough that it is definitely a person and sentient being with rights and thoughts and feelings and ability to feel sensations such as pain (which it most definitely feels when it is aborted and dies after it has reached this development stage) and most of the abortion debate was about things like quality of life. A good portion of the arguments and logic I see here being applied to fetuses could very well be applied to young children as well and thats scary. Also I see the mothers life is in danger argument/scenario a lot on dear blueno. I was also under the assumption that most pro lifers do not argue that in a life or death situation for the mother, she should not be able to abort the baby. """

Save a few blips, I was generally cheerful and optimistic. It took nothing to rise to the occasion of studying for things and acing them. Here, Im a mess. College was supposed to be an extremely fun, life changing experience, but Im probably depressed and hopeless % of the days here. Increasingly, Im just finding myself wanting to lie in bed and stay there forever. I slept for hours last night. There have even been some scary moments where Ive contemplated killing myself. I cant talk about it with my parents. My mom would freak out if she hears that her perfect son, her golden boy, is woefully depressed. Whenever I tell peopleeven just a little bitabout my situation, their response is always, Im here if you need to talk. Im not sure if talking is what I need. I feel like I need some sort of antidepressant to be honest. And that scares me. Ive prided myself on not needing antidepressants to be happy. Heres a case in point: I was at a friends house after thanksgiving, and a wishbone was lying on his counter. We decided to break it together. Of course, I dont believe in any of thatbut I still made a wish. In the past, my wish wouldve been something materialperhaps getting into Brown or getting a prized internship. I wished that I could just not be sad anymore. That I could find genuine happiness. Im going home for winter break soon, and I know thatll probably ameliorate my situation. But it concerns me quite a bit that school makes me this way now. """

(no, because preemies, right?) is it whenever the fetus is removed from the womb? (no, because then the fetus is considered living or non living based solely on the timing of an action of a third party, which can happen at an arbitrary time during gestation, rather than life being an inherent characteristic). is it some sort of schroedingers fetus situation then? i am so genuinely curious about this! this is a point that i think is worth active discussion on the abortion position from many different viewpoints, instead of predetermining which side hates women and which side is the moral Elite tm"""

We paid special attention to striking a balance between anonymity and actionability. This clarified the resources Tech House members have to make complaints and what standard procedure is in handling them. The full amendment can be read here (brown email required to view): https://docs.google.com/document/d/ zCs/edit Created two complaints forms, one of which is anonymous, to ensure that complaints can be made easily. We created the anonymous form to ensure that all are empowered to submit grievances in a way with which they are comfortable. The non anonymous form is available here: https://forms.gle/ The anonymous form is available here: https://forms.gle/ Decided that, starting next semester, two in house restorative justice circles will be run by our SAPE liaisons. Created a list of Tech House guidelines and community values to clarify expected behavior by members, guests, and alumni. While we are confident in these steps that weve already taken, our efforts dont stop now. Moving forward, we intend to continue discussions about how to make our community the best it can be, review our community guidelines every year to evolve and affirm them, and hold in house ombudsperson and SAPE liaison office hours to ensure their visibility and availability.

However, when my or most Brown students' parents pay the Student Activities Fee, it is charged with the assumption that the money is used for Brown students, not to pay someone rent. I do not believe that helping people with their rent is wrong, or that clubs should not do this but it should not be done with money that charged for another purpose. Let be clear this is charity. If clubs want to do that, they should raise money, specifically for charity. Yes, that is difficult. Yes, Brown administration doesn give a shit about this. But that is not justification for using money that was taken for another purpose. A lot of parents and students struggle to pay the Brown tuition, a lot of others do not struggle that much, but it is still a huge expense for them. Financial aid fucks over the middle class and international students. Once again, I am not against this charity but it should be done through proper means. Brown doing wrong things doesn mean you can justify using money marked for other purposes."""

Not to mention that they only have one side of the Ratty open so theres not very many options for people with food allergies or restricted diets. Im extremely disappointed that Brown hasnt done more for its students that cant go home during Thanksgiving. I know there are many other universities (with smaller endowments) that make accommodations for students over the break so they dont have to worry about how to eat during the holidays, why cant Brown do the same?"

5229,2019-12-01 10:19:00," Hey everyone, I a senior here, studying abroad right now, but coming back next semester, and presently reflecting on my time at Brown in particular, about how much I feel like I failed and missed out on things, especially having anything resembling a fulfilling social life and sense of belonging and acceptance. So, we heard people say how Brown is such a wonderful and accepting place that they feel so attached to, and how they made so many friends. And for those who didn at first, we heard about how it all gets better in the end and they able to come out of their shell and figure things out. Now, I been working a lot lately on getting my life into shape, and I tried throughout my years here to succeed socially and feel happy and secure in general, but looking at it now, I realize I failed, and it too late to fix that. I was hoping that when I finally escaped my tiny K school and got to college, I would be able to finally come out of my shell. I would finally make a ton of friends, feel like I was part of a strong community, get invited to a ton of fun parties and events, maybe even find a relationship, and in general, feel validated. In contrast, my mental health and self esteem continually deteriorated throughout my time here, and while I definitely think that I grown and made friends, I never got anywhere near what I was hoping for. Especially holding in mind these expectations and the idea that find my place"" and would get better,"" my experience at Brown has been continuously full of disappointments, despite the fact that I been constantly trying to make things better. I constantly felt the clock ticking away as I, having no idea what I was supposed to do, kept running out of chances to have a fulfilling social life and escape the fear of being forever alone. And now, I realize that time is already just about up. So, if I may ask something from other Brown students and alumni, can we acknowledge that it doesn always get better in the way we hope? Can we have some sympathy for the social outcasts the people around us who suffer in silence, for years, even? Thank you."

5358,2019-11-25 02:41:00, Is it too much to ask that Orgo be taught by a reasonable professor? I don think I ever hated a professor and a class as much as I hated this one. I not just bitching because the last exam was tough. I used to actually like chemistry and Basu ruined it for me. How difficult can it be to actually teach the class instead of sending us to the fucking textbook and not being clear about what we need to know from it? How hard can it be to provide actual fucking answer keys to packets??? Or give reasonable partial credit on exams?????? Why is it that the grading system is set so that you get points off for the same mistake twice???? How about providing averages for the exams or more concrete grade borders that do not span %? For fucks sake I have to pass other classes and at this point I would like to know if I should bother studying for this class to try and get a higher grade or settle for the lower one. It is so shocking to me that the Chemistry department is so inept that they have managed to become the thing I despise the most about Brown. And to think that this entire shit show could have been avoided if they decided to have a good teacher (Morton or Zimmt) teach this class. What is the point of attending a University like this if not to get decent professors?

5529,2019-11-22 01:01:00," topics: anti semitism @ While "" identifying people in positions of wealth and power"""" is a big oof, there is a point to be made on how race affects this debate. Most Jews in the US are white and experience most of the privileges of whiteness (when they don, it usually because their whiteness has come into question). The dynamics of antisemitism in Europe don really work here because America is organized more around race. And when a white Jew argues against a (more likely to be) POC Muslim in a public forum on something like Palestine, the Jewish person is likely to hold a lot of advantages. Muslims often might have to start by proving that they not """""" or anti Semitic (which is applied against Muslims en masse by racists), and they often arguing to a white audience that already questions their humanity. For example, it normal for politicians in the US to be openly Islamaphobic and the current president has even tried to ban Muslims from entering. Like, last night Bernie statement that Palestinians deserve to be treated with "" and respect"""" was somehow treated as super radical. So you have to consider that it not quite an even playing field (not to mention blacklists like Canary Mission which try to intimidate people from speaking out). Being white and Jewish can give someone an advantage in this debate, and it fair to people to call that out."""

5588,2019-11-21 04:34:00," topics: anti semitism While I dont believe that any criticism of Israel is inherently antisemitic, I also dont believe that non Jewish people should feel they have the right to tell Jews what is and what isnt antisemitism. I hate to be ~that guy~ but I honestly dont believe that, at Brown, this would (or should) fly with other isms. However, a previous Dear Blueno post seemed to insinuate that, because Jewish students at Brown come from wealth and power (which... yikes) their claims of antisemitism can reasonably be challenged. While Jews belong to many different races worldwide, its true that most Jews in the US come from European roots, making it easier for American Jews to blend in with the white majorityhowever, please remember that this is really only possible due to decades of assimilation often at the expense of language, tradition, and culture. While many white Jews have been able to escape hate and discrimination due to this ability to blend in, many have not, as the majority of religious hate crimes are targeted at Jews, who make up ~% of the US population. While many might think that antisemitism is something of the past, or just not really a thing in America (opinion polls demonstrate that this is a relatively common belief among non Jews), antisemitism is a serious problem in the US. However its often only brought into the mainstream consciousness after the next guy shoots up, bombs, or vandalizes a synagogue. Many Jewish students at Brown are the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, and the children of those raised by Holocaust survivors. If theyre anything like me, theyve been raised to be constantly looking over their shoulderstaught that theyre never really completely safe. That regardless of any privilege they have, they should never become complacent because, historically, economic and racial privilege have never protected Jews from genocide, expulsion, or disenfranchisement. This is likely why many Jewish students are so vigilant when the Israel/ Palestine debate comes up, since some (not all!) anti Israel movements do have a history of virulent antisemitism. I bring all this up to put into context the discourse about who can determine what is and isnt antisemitism. While Im sure it can be frustrating to feel like people are trying to invalidate your arguments with charges of antisemitism, I ask you to please not let these feelings of frustration turn into attempts to in turn invalidate claims of antisemitism coming from Jews themselvesmany of whom have been raised to be hyper aware of their surroundings by those affected by the Holocaust."""

5677,2019-11-20 06:09:00," Hot take on armpit hair discourse. Its not okay to tell women what to do with their bodies. I cant and shouldnt tell anyone to shave their armpits. But what I can do is inform them about the common perception of womens body hair, so that if youre a woman who does care what men/women think (you dont have to care, but maybe you do), you are now more able to make an informed decision. The fact is that most men arent fans of women having body hair, and many are kinda grossed out by it. This has been verified by surveys and studies if youd like to Google them. Please dont say that this is problematic for me to say because it is literally a verifiable fact, and is not meant to be offensive to those who choose to not shave. To me personally, its a major turn off. I associate body hair with masculinity, so as someone who isnt attracted to masculine traits, you can see why Id be turned off. Its also just kinda gross to me, like even as a dude I dont like my own body hair. And in addition to all that Im sure theres some societal/cultural stuff going on that (for better or worse) has conditioned me to not like it. Again, Im opening up about my own individual feelings, so take that for what its worth and nothing more. Think of it as analogous to having snot hanging out of your nose. I literally have no right to tell you to get rid of it, but I will be grossed out and will probably look away. So yeah, that was my hot take. If you disagree, please dont call me a misogynist. If I were doing something that was a turn off to women, Id kinda want to know so I could make an informed decision of whether my personal preference is more or less important than what will be appealing to the people that Id like to be attracted to me. My only goal is for people to be more informed so they understand that their choice may affect their attractiveness in the eyes of the preferred gender. Have a great day."

Linda Sarsour is anti Semitic. You cannot tell me that Im taking her statements out of context or thats not what she really meant what Sarsour said has hurt me."""" There are some good points in this article about Sarsour past statements, but I think this is a problematic definition of antisemitism that deserves to be pushed back on, as I seen it echoed a lot (, ) even in reference to Palestine. Many Jews in campus may not have encountered Palestinian perspectives before coming to Brown, and encountering them for the first time can make many uncomfortable, especially if their families or communities back home are more staunchly Zionist. There were a lot of complaints on this page, for example, that the "" Wall"""" display was anti Semitic, because it made some viewers feel uncomfortable as Jews rather than any specific parts of the display being problematic. There was a BDH oped at the time (which I didn write) about someone who initially experienced something that seems similar, and while I don want to speak for them, I think it worth linking. http://www.browndailyherald.com////aman creating productive dialogue israel palestine/ If someone feels like Israel is a big part of their Jewish identity, and they dismiss Palestinian activism as anti Semitic because it makes them feel uncomfortable in a way related to their Jewish identity, then we have to use a definition of antisemitism that goes beyond what makes some people uncomfortable. This issue also affects Palestinians (definitely moreso than American Jews), and their voices deserve to be heard. The debate around israel intersects with a lot of issues (racism, colonialism, etc.) that white Jews especially may not be as prepared to immediately weigh in as they are with other forms of antisemitism. It especially problematic when Jewish allies of Palestinians (like JVP) are dismissed on this page when attempting to defend against claims of antisemitism, as though the original posters feelings of discomfort are final. If you feel that JVP presence doesn at least complicate accusations of antisemitism or warrant further thought then you probably valuing some Jewish voices more than others. A lot of people here seem to think that being pro Palestinian somehow makes you less Jewish."""

Of course, it may be inevitable, but I don think it can really be justified as a goal. For the much larger of people who support a two state solution: where should the borders be drawn? Should they be hard borders? What about Palestinian right of return? Finally, what about Jerusalem?

If you have a couple sweaters and a light rain jacket that will generally do very nicely in all but the worst weather. A fleece or wool hat is essential and a balaclava/bandanna on the windiest/coldest days. A warm place to tuck your hands or a good pair of gloves is also nice. Good waterproof hiking boots are a nice to have for snow and slush as well and have a good grip on any ice. You might want to pack an extra pair of shoes and socks though since they can be very warm when you are inside. I know weather clothing isn exactly cheap but you can very cozy for a budget if you use what you already have and shop carefully. Finally, for the love of all that is sacred walk single file on the sidewalk so people can get past you especially when much of the sidewalk is covered by snow or ice. Stay warm out there."""

However, we have a huge ice menorah on Wriston during Hanukkah.

On the Israel issue, I see pro Israel people who have no sympathy whatsoever for the Palestinian people. They cant comprehend the possibility that a country they love might actually be doing bad things and causing widespread suffering among a marginalized population. Similarly, I see anti Israel people who totally do not care that Israelis face terrorist attacks on a regular basis. They think that living in a westernized country makes Israelis immune from harm and suffering, and they dont understand that many of the people on their side actually do hate Jews, even if they personally don. These people will claim to have nuanced views. Just because I care about Israel doesnt mean I hate Palestinians. Just because I dont think Israel should exist, doesnt mean Im antisemitic. But I rarely see these claims pan out. If you really arent antisemitic, then defend Jews when theyre attacked by your fellow anti zionists. If you really care about Palestinians, then speak up when your country hurts them. Back your words with actions. """

5881,2019-11-17 03:28:00," In the beginning of the semester I added to my course load with the assumption that I was going to genuinely learn how to code, and I would receive help in the process, on what I dont understand. Throughout the semester I have learned that no one will really help you in that class. Some of the TAs are obnoxious or dont even want to be there. Like why become a TA if your not actually doing it to help people. You shouldve gotten a job at a library or anywhere else. I remember I waited two hours to see a TA, when I got called in, she was hungover, annoyed at everything, and looked at me like if I was an idiot for not fully understanding what WE had just leaned THAT week. After several interactions in which I felt like I could not get the proper help I needed I dropped the class, which hurt me so much since I enjoyed it, and dedicated most of my week for that class, putting other class aside. TA hours are incredibly idiotic too! A person cant move on with their assignment because theres a bug in the code, which they cant identify, and they need to wait about hour and minutes,on average, to be seated with a good or terrible TA, game of chance and no in between, for min or question. Like that does not make sense at all. Other CS classes have their TA OH IN THE COMPUTER ROOM, Cs I believe, a person just raises their hand, gets immediate help, and boom they move on. Theres no need to lock your computer, go upstairs, wait x amount of time, log back in, wait for eclipse to load, THATS A WASTE OF TIME! Even if your the first one to sign up min before the start of OH there is no guarantee that you will be seen first since they randomize the list. Instead of doing skits, and figuring out how you will get Andy their drink every class, actually try to perfect the job you are paid to do before you can start doing skits or whatever. It is really sickening and sad how the TA system works in this class. There is only a handful of TAs that are actually good at their jobs and take the time explain the content, work through problems or whatever. I dont want to violate the policy to call out people, but if you actually are one of those TAs thank you. You understand that taking a TA job actually means helping people and not making them feel idiotic for asking questions. I understand that TAs are students as well, and sometimes they might be overwhelmed with their own work, relationship issues, and just life, but if you take a job to be a TA there is an understanding that you will need to put in double the effort in your job and not actually half ass it. Some you are getting paid, and your able to make your resume look good. TAs are basically the teachers of the class, how am I supposed to understand the concept if the person who is supposed to help me half asses their work."

5940,2019-11-17 03:06:00," topics: israel/palestine, anti semitism, linda sarsour There been a lot of criticism on this page recently directed at SJP for hosting Linda Sarsour. Yes, Linda Sarsour has been too uncritical of Louis Farrakhan. She has been complicit when it comes to his vile anti Semitic and homophobic comments in a way that undermines the intersectional causes she otherwise espouses. Yet have any of you really wondered why she and Tamika Mallory have chosen to work with Nation of Islam, besides being quick to assume that POC don care about anti Semitism? Sarsour and Mallory have worked for decades in some of America most forsaken areas. These areas aren even on the radar most white liberals, and in some cases, they are the places where the NOI is strongestearning sympathy for their work against poverty and violence even if people reject the NOI anti Semitism. Even Rahm Emanuel, the first Jewish mayor of Chicago, has acknowledged this, crediting them for reducing violence in Chicago, while Ta Nehisi Coates (who white liberals love) has praised Farrakhan disregard for the opinions of the white establishment. Activists like Sarsour and Mallory have often had to work with the NOI just due to proximity, and they might remember Farrakhan more as the person behind the Million Man March than for the press occasional interest in his anti Semitic comments. (Why do you think Obama of all people posed for a picture with him?) Still, Farrakhan is a vile anachronism, and under his leadership the NOI is just a shadow of its former self. Sarsours refusal to denounce him is discrediting when she is trying to lead an intersectional, nation wide movement. Its difficult to renounce those one once worked with, but Sarsour has made the wrong choice in this regard. But it is a stunning hypocrisy for the Zionists on this page to fault her for that. Many of you regularly defend the establishment of a state that was founded through the ethnic cleansing of indigenous people (how else does one get a Jewish majority state in Palestine?), where hundreds of thousands were forced out of their homes to refugee ghettos across the middle east. This is supposedly just a sacrifice necessary to establish a Jewish stateyet those of you so willing to sacrifice people youve never met would never even set foot in one of the neighborhoods the NOI works in. There have even been recent threads () where Zionists have listed various indigenous lands like a goddamn menu, debating the climate and real estate without a care for the people they know they would displace. You know your pro Israel and anti Divest activism enables the Occupation, yet you keep doing it, even as just this week the IDF has slaughtered dozens in cold blood. (And how many IDF veterans has BSI hosted?) Yes, Sarsour is flawed, but she is one of the most famous Palestinian Americans alive, bravely speaking out at a time when pro Palestinian politics are woefully underrepresented (and simply limiting aid to Israelthe same weapons killing families in Gaza right nowis somehow considered progressive). Seeing the way some of you so casually dismiss those seeking to reduce Palestinian suffering as anti Semitic, its also no wonder Sarsour has made comments questioning how that label is often applied. For those of you who dont consider yourselves Zionsitsgreat! None of this applies to you, and as far as I know you have every right to question this decision on the part of SJP. But for those of you who are Zionists, you might want to show a little more sympathy to those like Sarsour and SJP who are making difficult decisions for a cause they believe in. """

First of all, my team culture being all guys is obviously not the most safe space in the world, and even though I love all my teammates, I just know it would make the whole vibe different and uncomfortable. The thing is, I actually love playing my sport for Brown and I am, at least in my eyes, a big contributor to my team with potential to be a captain (I am a sophomore now). But my team relies so heavily on trust and I want my teammates to feel comfortable with me and I worry that I am jeopardizing my team chemistry and my shot and a successful leadership position by coming out. What sucks is I am in a catch because just having to think about this all the time and hiding that part of me is starting to affect my play, and I am so scared to come out to anyone else in my life in fear that it will get back to my team.

He was a black actor born in who left the United States to pursue acting in the UK and eventually all across Europe and into Russia. He played with his Black identity to build his public image, provided a rare counter point to the black face performers he replaced, and showed a keen understanding of the English theatre landscape which he used to his advantage. He used his platform to criticize slavery and often took roles that showed black people empowered. His legacy inspired several American acting troupes named in his honor which catered to black audiences and rejected and subverted racist character stereotypes of the day. His article, and those on The Grove Theatre and African Free School are really worth reading. I found them to be filled with modern day parallels, brave people who were ahead of their time and a stark portrait of how African Americans were treated for minding their own business. """

But a guy and me really hit it off and holy fuck Just a few highlights: I woke up in the morning and he was holding me from behind, he pulled around and kissed my head. He got over to my place after work and he tackled me. He leans his head on me while we are on the couch watching movies. He sends me stupid little messages throughout the day. Pretty much any time I lying down and he will lie on top of me. Honestly it just makes every day so much better. It is worth working on yourself but I now starting to understand the people who rush back into relationships. That intimacy (when genuine) is addicting"""

I have a lot of social anxiety but have been so desperate that Ive been pushing through it and reaching out to a lot of people. The thing is, nearly every single one is constantly cancelling me or stops answering my texts after being like yes lets have tea/do a thing! I know people are busy but its so hard to make new connections here when nobody gives a fuck about you. Its really making me want to give up."
6854,2019-11-02 06:34:00," Im so desperate to get out of my moms suffocating hold. She found out I earned money from my internship and I had to hide my debit card in my bra so she didnt find it and confiscate it. She embarrassed me wherever I go and always creates a drama infused situation and then tells me to calm down when I react accordingly to the negative things shes been perforating all night. She digs through my trash and glued together pieces of paper to figure out what I was doing or what I bought with my money. At this point Ive started to sell my body for money. Not in the upfront prostitution kind of way because it is so black and white illegal and dangerous, but Ive been in relationships with men and women alike who pay for these relationships because nobody would deal with them otherwise and thats the truth of the matter. Yet they still treat me better than my parents ever did. I feel important around them because at least theyve earned their right to be assholes through actually having stuff to show for their pride. Yesterday I hid in the CIT for hours because my mom was around campus and I couldnt deal with her anymore. And theres nobody I respect less than my dad. How could a man stand by and have all these horrible things happen to his daughter that he can clearly see is stripping away her spirit and her dreams? Ever since Ive begun sugar dating (lets just be real thats what it is) Ive never looked at sex the same again. The drunken hookups that we all love to hate... well Id love to go back to when that was the biggest sexual thing that happened in my life. Ive become desensitized to what normal sex and normal relationships are like and I feel like if I went back it would be like giving a drug addict Jell O shots. And when people insult me now its like.. was that even an insult? I wish I could feel what it was like when the worst things said were comments by friends that felt like a backhanded compliment but probably was just carelessness or a forgivable moment of pettiness.

Most people are going to sleep with many other people without protection and therefore get HPV, putting them at risk of cancer, but if people only had one partner with whom they did not use protection (and that partner also always used protection with their other partners), neither would get HPV or almost any other sexually transmitted disease. Don get me wrong, I think everyone should get their HPV shots, but I guess what I am saying is that I also think everyone should use more protection or consider not sleeping with multiple partners without protection. We could literally decrease the risk of so many STDs and illnesses if we just used protection with almost all of our partners, except the one we decided to be with very long term."

For outer hemorrhoids: Hemorrhoid creams and witch hazel wipes are helpful to lower inflammation in the area taking sits baths for min if you have a bath is generally nice And If your pain doesnt decrease over time please see health services or a provider in the area to get a consultation.

7413,2019-10-24 10:31:00," I really hate the anti greek life sentiment on campus. I know it has a bad rap, and for good reason at times, but for me, I had no friends and was truly depressed at brown until I decided to rush a fraternity. Now I love brown, I can wait to come back to school after every break and hang out and have fun with my friends. I had always considered myself a really normal person in high school. I liked to go out and loved to party, but I had no friends to go with at Brown. there was never really a chance for me to have a social outlet at this school until i rushed. I know it sounds lame, but there is really something to be said about the bonding that occurs over a shared identity that is really just about camaraderie having fun. I always see comments here advising people who feel like they don have friends that should join this club or that club, but for me, none of that ever worked. There something different about clubs vs social organizations. I really think for kids like me, who knew nobody coming into this school, that greek life provided me with a home and a place where I felt like I could actually have fun. I really believe this campus should work towards making greek life more inclusive, affordable, and safe as opposed to pushing it off campus. The off campus frats and sports houses always have the best parties and it seems like (at least some of them) really try to make things as safe as possible, even going so far as to show entrants a list of rules. Imagine how much safer people would feel if the school brought those houses back on campus. It sounds lame to just want to "" but clearly there is a high demand for students who want these outlets, and brown, (just like with SSDP) is making an unwise decision by pushing them off."

7545,2019-10-22 03:35:00," topics: dem nom For Brown students considering Warren: https://www.currentaffairs.org///why criticize warren A few excerpts (see the article itself for citations): Let me just recap once again the facts of this story: Warren said for many years that she was a woman of color, listing her race as American Indian on government forms. Because she said she was a woman of color, Harvard was able to pretend that it had a woman of color on the law school faculty, at a time when it was embroiled in a scandal for not hiring any non white women. Warren, when confronted about this, has tried to change the subject, by insisting that she was hired for her merit rather than for her fraudulent racial claims. (We will leave aside the ugly way that this defense implies affirmative action hires are not merit based.) She has never held herself accountable for the actual problem, which is that she helped Harvard legitimize not hiring non white people, because they were able to claim that they already had an American Indian on staff. I dont know if youve looked into Elizabeth Warrens corporate consulting background before, but its not good. A Washington Post report suggested that it had received little scrutiny and that when fully exposed it could offer her opponents fresh avenues for attack. Warren, it said, had worked on far more corporate cases than she initially disclosed, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars on the side advising (among others) chemical companies, oil companies, banks, and insurers on how to navigate bankruptcy proceedings. In one case, Warren argued that an aircraft manufacturer should be shielded from liability for a deadly accident that killed a NASCAR star. (I can already see the attack ads now, featuring the deceased drivers family, talking about how Elizabeth Warren says she is for the people but tried to keep them from getting compensation. Trump will probably have the drivers widow in the audience at the debates.) The Washington Post homed in on one particular case, in which Warren worked on behalf of Dow Chemical: One of her most controversial clients was Dow Chemical, which she advised in the mid . A subsidiary that manufactured silicone gel breast implants faced hundreds of thousands of claims from women who said their implants caused health problems. Dow Chemical denied that it played a role in designing or making the implants and sought to avoid liability as its subsidiary, Dow Corning, declared bankruptcy."""

His policies arent as strong as they should be, but as a candidate he seems to be more open minded and forward thinking than someone like Biden who wants to bring back the good old days where the president wasnt openly racist but still didnt really do shit to address racism. His moderation seems more like just a desire to avoid polarization than a desire to maintain the status quo.

There is increasing rhetoric on campus that the attempt at a Jewish state is a failure that has made the victim the bully, putting the power to blindly kill in the hands of those who not long ago experienced the same fate. The true Israel and Israel are not the same. The Israel that stands on the true land of Israel today has lost sight of what it means to be a Jew and is profiting off of the unconditional support the US offers as well as the military industrial complex whose current business isnt just to defend Israel but now is committing unforgivable atrocities. Personally I still believe the land of Israel is the homeland of the Jews, and that the true Israel must continue to exist. As a Jew I am caught between a rock and a hard place. I do not condone the atrocities, but I cant stand idly by while we as Jews are looked down upon because of this, and the necessity of a Jewish homeland is questioned as well. There continues to be a false equation of Jews and Israel on this campus. As Jews, we are not Israel. We should not want to be associated with Israel, the nation who is killing women and children and whose evil deeds have bloodied the cause for establishing and keeping the Jewish homeland. This true Israel, the dream of the Zionists, in which the Jews can remain and be safe in their holy lands of Jerusalem and surrounding territories, must continue to live on. The lines have been blurred. The Israel that kills has co opted the dream of our people, seized power, and committed violence under the name of our homeland. The Israel that stands for everything good the Jewish people have lived for is an entity that has been overshadowed by Israel. This is the relationship between Israel and Israel. I am a Brown Student for Israel. The true Israel. Dont get it twisted. """

While the program itself is helpful to ensure that students have safe substances they intend to use during Spring Weekend, it frustrates me that people praise this policy without even considering or talking about the matter of how everyone else who doesnt live up on this hill doesnt get to enjoy the same privileges. Poor Black and brown people are still getting locked up for selling, using, or even being suspected of having drugs. Meanwhile, students at Brown can publicly consume drugs and illicit substances without so much as a ticket, and on top of that, had the support of the University through this harm reduction program. That doesnt mean that students shouldnt be able to have safe substances, but please start including the wider audience in this conversation, because we can be mad about this, but I want to see more outrage at the continuous criminalization of drug use in non Ivy League spaces."

Its as if you want all the privileges granted to people who can claim to have been a part of a western oppressor democracy but are unwilling to reform your own country so that the same privileges can be granted to more of your compatriots. And yeah, I do get it. If the CCP gives in to the youth of Hong Kong, theyll have to give in to all their other citizens who want a share of the power pie and because I dont see the CCP transitioning peacefully into a democracy anytime soon, thatll lead to some pretty serious political instability.

Right now I just see a lot of denial from the privileged population in China who dismiss people who disagree as western brainwashed meddling, and repeat propaganda without trying to break any of it down because Im sure a lot of you only see the elements of truth to the arguments and dont even realize that the other half is all just propaganda to maintain the power of the CCP (yeah America does have a history of criticizing China for its own ends but those arguments also still stem from a place of truth) Also if were gonna have this discussion, I suggest we have it on Facebook and not wechat bc spoiler alert wechat is monitored by the CCP and Facebook is not.

You imply that "" just ignorant Westerners hating on China,"""" but realize that it not just the """""" where many people take an antagonistic stance against the Chinese Communist Party. From what I seen, it also virtually the entirety of Pacific Asia: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka. Why so many grievances from so many people across the world? Perhaps, just maybe, it because these grievances were never about "" mainland brainwashing."""" Maybe we do know what we are talking about. You claim "" government wants nothing but success and strong morals for its people"""" (although, if they really wanted to achieve the people interests, they wouldn have defied the voices of millions in Tiananmen and murdered thousands of its own people. But I digress.) but you fail to realize that this line of thinking is the crux of the issue. What does it take to achieve "" good for the nation?"""" It entails subjugating the Uyghurs to concentration camps, sterilizing them and destroying their cultural land; it entails kidnapping, assaulting and murdering dissents in Hong Kong and imposing authoritarian values to an otherwise democratic city; it entails using its position of power to delegitimize Taiwan; it entails promoting vengeful nationalism through vilification of Western nations and using the "" of Humiliation"""" narrative; it entails using its position of power to forcibly control territory, such as the Nine Dashed Line in South East Asia; it entails using its economic power and debt trap diplomacy to exploit Kenya, Zambia and Djibouti and seize their national infrastructure and natural resources, solely for the benefit of Chinese companies and at the expense of those nation citizens; it entails promoting the rejection of democratic values and civil liberties, such as in Latin America by exporting surveillance technology to authoritarian parties in the region. The Communist Party of China presents to the world that it does not rule by law or justice. It rules by power and violence. Mainland Chinese interests (and more importantly, the Party interests) are prioritized at the expense of everyone else interests. They are achieved through any means possible, through invasive and controlling methods that violate human rights and international laws. Anyone who opposes is suppressed, through harassment and violence. It stands for everything Brown University and its people have fought against, and Brown (and the West in general) is right to continue fighting against it. Doing so is not "","""" "" anti mainland sentiment"""" or "" false news""""; it is seeking justice in the same way we seek justice in our own governments. Post script. On the Hong Kong issue. I witnessed the Umbrella Movement back in when I was in Hong Kong. Although I am in Brown now, some of my friends go to college in Hong Kong and live there. Some of my friends live outside elsewhere, but head back to Hong Kong frequently because they have family there. What they tell me is largely the same. There is so much that I can write about, on the topic of whether foreign intervention is involved, of the demographics of the protestors, of the brutality of the police. I can elaborate in another post, but what I most urgently want to say right now is this: Please educate yourself. Read up on the Civil Rights Movement, on the democracy movement in China, and on the democratization movements in Taiwan and South Korea. They all have unnerving parallels with the current movement in Hong Kong. You question why the protestors in Hong Kong are all "" young people,"""" but the protestors in Tiananmen, too, were largely led by students in Beijing. They, too, were accused of "" brainwashed with Western ideals and values."""" They, too, were disillusioned and angry about how the values of people rights touted by the nation did not match up with the corrupt, authoritarian realities they were living in. It not exactly a new phenomenon. Your bold claims make it clear that you have little to no idea on the nature of the protests, nor did you spend time to think about why the protestors are doing what they are doing. You clearly have not been to Hong Kong, nor do you have any evidence (first hand or second hand) to back up your claims. Instead, you chose to end up in the same pitfalls that others in history have fell in: hatred, dismissal, and generalization. Ironic that you accuse the """""" of spouting "" media,"""" yet you yourself present an incredibly myopic view of the situation, parroting the exact same lines the Chinese news media outlets speak of.

Put aside the wounded protestors for a moment, how are you going to defend the police use of force when an Indonesian journalist was shot with rubber bullet right on the face and was blinded in one eye because of that? Can you still proudly share People Dailys meme that says I support Hong Kong police and now you can beat me. What a shame for Hong Kong. Can you? If you do believe theres absolutely nothing wrong on the police side, then I guess we have very little room for further conversations. Second, youre arguing that Hong Kongs protest and Western medias coverage is undermining Chinas sovereignty and values. Do you actually read over the protestors five demands? . Complete withdrawal of the extraction bill. . Retract the characterization of riots on June protest . Release arrested protestors without charges . Independent investigation into police violence . Implementation of full universal suffrage After Hong Kong people taking to the streets for consecutive weeks, the SAR government finally agreed to meet the first demand but still refused to meet the rest four. In what sense do you think Chinas sovereignty and values will be determined, if all five demands are met? None of these is related with Hong Kong independence. And Im pretty sure, as a Brown educated student with some conscience, protesting against the government for its attempt to pass a legislation that sends its people to a judicial regime lack of transparency and embracing human rights/freedom/democracy is in one of our values. Third, theres actually nothing to do with Taiwan here, but since you mentioned it, I wanted to take this chance to reply to you. You said the West attempts to fuel anti mainland sentiment in Taiwan. Could you provide some proofs to support your argument? On the other hand, when I read how the West is covering Taiwans news, I always feels that the West has, instead, been very careful not to irritate China on reporting Taiwan. For example, when Taiwan passed same sex marriage legalization earlier this year, the West mainstream media reported it as first in Asia and almost every outlet avoided using the term country in their coverage. And I guess its just fundamentally hard for Taiwanese people nowadays to align themselves to the Chinese identity, especially when Taiwanese people have the right to go to the polls to elect their own President every four year and celebrate their National Day on Oct not on Oct . Does this really have anything to do with the West? However, if you do strongly think Taiwan is a province of China and that you do champion LGBT rights like the majority of Brown student does, you can help by doing something very simple: march through the streets in China to pressure every other province to follow Taiwans same sex marriage legalization. Fourth, a bit off tangent here but whats your take on the concentration camp in Xinjiang where a million of Muslims is detained? Do you really think its just piece of fake news conspired by the West in order to demonize China? If yes...this is very unfortunate and itll make me feel very sad that my one of fellow Brown students thinks this way. """

7975,2019-10-12 11:27:00," Its pretty ludicrous that so many Americans act so self righteous on topics they really dont know anything about. The sheer confidence they espouse when throwing around loaded/politicized concepts and facts whose underlying meaning and circumstances they neither understand nor care to find out is utterly astonishing. For people who claim tolerance as a fundamental virtue, who boast of their acceptance and embracement of differences in the world, who preen themselves on their cosmopolitan wokeness, to uphold one set (their set) of values, institutions, practices, and way of life to be the universal standard is a paradox of the highest order. They never pause to consider whether certain concepts have been made into rhetorical weapons, whether double standards are practiced in the characterization of certain events, whether extremely complex circumstances have been crystallized into one punchy narrative that completely ignores its vast underside. It is high time that we truly appreciate and celebrate the diversity in our world, by suppressing the danger of the single story, by listening humbly and attentively to the voices of the other side, by acknowledging, above all, that there are institutions, cultures, and ways of life dramatically different from those of ours, yet whose right to exist is no less legitimate. The problems surrounding Hong Kong have deep and intricate roots. They can only be resolved through the cooperation of all sides. Violence, especially the chaotic rioting that we have witnessed in recent weeks, is simply not conducive to any resolution. Ultimately, however, these problems are Chinas internal problems. The extent to which sinister foreign forces have been involved in inciting violence and buttressing it with tons and tons of money have revealed in the clearest possible terms their subversive intentions. As a sovereign nation whose sovereignty over Hong Kong is indubitable, China ought to have the right to decide on the best path forward, and to do so without undue foreign intervention. As a final note: every former colony, after the retreat of its former imperial master, has gone through a process of decolonization that seeks to remove or transform the imposed social political institutions and ideologies. Hong Kong, however, is an exception. It has largely maintained British colonial practices in all areas of governance and all walks of life, to the extent that foreign judges still sit on its courts and its younger generations still feel greater attachment to the former imperial master after twenty two years. Is this normal? Think about it. Try climbing into Chinese peoples skin and walking around in it. Maybe youll see some things differently. """

8004,2019-10-12 10:31:00," I rented an apartment on the second floor of Chase Bank and Ben and Jerrys from Samson Realty. I am one of the only occupants of the entire floor most of the other apartments on the floor have been left unoccupied. I have the feeling that my landlord wants me gone. Hes sent me aggressive emails when I leave water bottles and boxes in the common kitchen area because I woke up late and have to rush to class and didnt have time to clean up. He calls me and then subjects me to yelling and the yelling is done in a fashion that serves to intimidate. His people come around on their own volition and enter the kitchen and bathroom. Sometimes when Im in my bathrobe after showering and that makes me feel violated. He has angrily told me that he cant believe I dare to put trash in the trash can. And any trash I have has to be put in the dumpster outside. He says my trash has been the reason that he has been unable to rent out the other rooms because people are so appalled. I had a chair of mine in the kitchen and he or his people deliberately put it under a hole in the ceiling that was dripping water from the rain. My chair got ruined due to the water. He continuously has called me when I am occupied with important things. I came here because I need a place to rant. I mean, I have a few ideas of why my living situation has become uncomfortable. But I also just wanted to put it out there in case something god forbid happens and I can have my classmates on Dear Blueno and the Brown community to vouch. Ive worked with lawyers and people who have been in situations with difficult people and what they always tell me is to document, document, document. So thats what Im doing now I need something out there. Ive gone on Google and places where consumer feedback is given and one of their allegations was that the owners of this place do everything they can to wipe bad review off Yelp and everything else. So Im turning to Dear Blueno just so people who are my classmates know whats going next on. I take full accountability for my words because I know that the truth will prevail no matter how much hell those trying to hide the truth try to wreak on you. I have sent pictures of living conditions such as texts about no hot water and a hole in the ceiling to lawyers Ive consulted with as well as my parents and friends in order to further document. Oh Dear Blueno, Im also here I guess because Im in need for some encouraging words and advice from the community. """

8013,2019-10-12 10:30:00," Since many of the other international Chinese students are too afraid to speak out, I will. Westerners are very ill informed of the issues going on with China and its territories. The media here is very biased and takes an anti China view as it has for decades. The West has always been afraid of China and challenged our rights. In fact, the American government and its allies make China out as an enemy. Thus, you that have never lived in China cannot take an educated view. Hong Kongs people have long been whitewashed due to being controlled by their colonizers, the British. Ever since the territory became one with China again, the West has fueled false news and angst against the mainland. Just as the West attempts to fuel anti mainland sentiment in Chinas Taiwan Province. The media makes it seem like everyone in Hong Kong is protesting, but it is only a small amount of youth influenced by the West who are destroying their economy and disrupting day to day activities. They are attacking Police and anyone who disagrees with them as well as vandalizing innocent peoples businesses. The West is trying to undermine Chinas sovereignty and values by brainwashing you about Hong Kong. Chinese people and the government want nothing but success and strong morals for the city and our other provinces. There is only one China. """
8014,2019-10-12 10:30:00," Coming to Brown as a moderate Democrat, I expected that the heavily liberal student body would provoke a reaction within me, pushing me to the right. This has not been the case at all. Ive warmed up to stances that I once viewed as extreme. Im now unapologetically supportive of many of the progressive policies I once laughed at. But why did I shift left and not right? I think the answer says a lot about Brown. If I had encountered progressives who shamed, isolated, cancelled, less liberal individuals, I most certainly wouldve reacted negatively to that. All it takes is a quick YouTube search to find tons of examples of what Im talking about. But as progressive as they are, Brown students arent like that. They present compelling arguments backed by logic, data, and/or real life examples. Rather than being overloaded with the SJW rhetoric that the Ben Shapiro crowd talks about, I was doused with damning evidence demonstrating that my moderate views were painfully weak and cowardly. This isnt to say that conservatives and moderates are objectively wrong. Im glad we have them on campus, and most genuinely believe in their perspective and can defend their stances well. But in my case, being a moderate wasnt who I was meant to be, and Im glad that the people here were both respectful and convincing enough to help me see the light."
8015,2019-10-12 10:30:00," While people are out here debating whether Brown should test their illegal drugs for them, can we take a sec to realize how out of touch and elitist this situation is? If some random person anywhere in Providence got caught with hard drugs, they would get charged with a felony and have a good chance of serving prison time. Their lives would be changed forever. But just because were Brown students, not only do people expect to be exempt from the law, they expect the university to test their drugs and thus be supporting/liable for their drug use??? This also says nothing of the power dynamics of students at a wealthy university purchasing drugs that economically desperate people across the world risked their lives to get to them. Im not trying to get on a high horse and tell you not to take whatever, and Im certainly not justifying the fucked up drug laws and criminal justice system in this country. Im also open to having my viewpoint critiqued. But overall, dont act like the fact that were even having this discussion isnt harmful and rooted in privilege..."

Sometimes if i feel i messed up talking to someone or embarrassed myself I feel compelled to rush back to my dorm and start cutting in order to relieve my frustration. I self harmed regularly since high school, i never thought much of it and have come to consider it a pretty normal thing, but my recent increase in this activity has kinda reminded me of the fact it can be harmful. ) the previous point tied to my anxiety which has grown pretty bad, and pretty much prevented me from making any friends for the few years i been here. When people show me even a little bit of attention or interest I feel really delighted, but can never really bring it past a casual conversation. I try to be as affable as possible, but I feel that there always some disconnect which prevents me from connection with others on a deeper level. It may also be that I afraid of overstepping my boundaries, or revealing parts of myself that I insecure about. I even get anxious over the thought of another person finding out that after three years here I don have friends cause that would maybe come off as weird, right? Maybe I set unrealistic expectations for myself, but in any case it hard to fight the nagging feeling that those expectations are reality ) In high school I was in a pretty dark place and did some things im not proud of, and since that period in my life I been actively trying to better myself by joining clubs, interacting with more people, and pursuing my passions. And though I accomplished those things on a superficial level, I feel like I haven changed much from the person I was in high school either. No matter what I do, I still facing the same mental barriers and retreating to the same methods of escape. For those reasons I feel like I never going to mature and get the things I want from life, and that what probably frustrates me the most. Like, even if i was to drop school and move to another country or change my identity, i would still be me, and the fact i cant change anything about that feels unbearable at times"""

Now I absolutely despise Trump as an individual and anyone who support him, but I also realizes that their right to speak their mind and to associate with their chosen political parties surpasses my political beliefs, so rather than welcoming, I would actually dread the(unlikely) day that the pressure make Brown take down any Trump flags, because that would lead to an environment where students will not be able to speak their mind freely just because some individuals put their values above other constitutional rights. I was a contrarian for most of my life, whether it was in my family for my far left ideals, or throughout high school for my radical beliefs about how society should operate, so I know how mind opening it could be to allow even a modicum of opposition into our lives and argue our hearts out in a free marketplace of ideas. Therefore, to anyone who oppose the Trump flag, please look at things from another perspective and respect their rights.

By giving people cash, you empower them to make decisions that will actually better their lives. Maybe that means fixing a guys car so he can take that higher paying job a few towns over. Maybe its buying an iPad so your year old kid can have access to online educational resources that his wealthier classmates already have access to. When I won money in an academic competition in high school, I used the money to by myself a camera, which got me into photography and probably helped me get into Brown.

8485,2019-10-03 02:33:00," topics: trump flag, cultural appropriation, On the topic of the donald trump flag and stuff or something like that idk wall of text incoming tldr ? op loves reddit and soy Disclaimer: I a registered democrat, I would not have voted for Donald Trump, I will not be voting for him next year. I don support his policies. I don know why that has to be mentioned in order to not disqualify everything I say in this post but we unfortunately live in a culture that ) makes character judgments based off of political ideology and ) makes political decisions based off of the party that one associates with as opposed to the more specific issues and topics brought up by particular candidates, regardless of partisanship. i didtn end up talking about donald trump lol, big gamer/memer I kind of just found out about this page this week, and it been interesting to look at what people have to say. This post is somewhat a response to topics discussed recently here on dear blueno, but I guess it more generally just letting out my frustration with a bunch of shit. I also don know how long these are allowed to be or whether anyone will read this entire thing, but a fuck i do not give. Here goes: First of all, regarding post from earlier today: I didn really agree with anything OP had to say, but the comments were kind of fucky. Most notably were those that were attempting to passive aggressively discredit the argument because of the fact that it was made anonymously. You know who you are, and I pretty sure these were bait, or maybe they just farming reddit gold, but just in case there are ever some that aren let me be very clear: Anonymity is absolutely pivotal in today society. Undermining someone ability to say what they like without the potential aforementioned character judgment is effectively shutting down an argument based on the medium by which it is argued and is therefore a fallacious judgment of character in and of itself. It also raises the question of why you looking at dear blueno to begin with. Get off your high horses with this pseud tier "" anonymous, therefore pussi xD"""" shit. College campuses can be home to some of the most divisive and controversial discussion in the world, and it your responsibility as a student to let it take place in all its forms without letting your emotions get the better of you. Allow people to express themselves however they choose (obviously within reason), and either bring something of value to the conversation or say nothing at all. To quote Chris Poole (no, I not a fucking idiot, thanks for asking), "" moving towards social networking, we moving towards persistent identity, we moving towards a lack of privacy... and in doing so, we losing something valuable."""" That thing of value that we have the potential to lose is freedom of expression without prudence; which I would argue is vital in driving the world forward. Also a side note on this topic, and sort of going back to what I said at the beginning about partisanship; although it understandably difficult, evaluating an argument not as a whole but as a collection of smaller ideas is much more worthwhile than the former. Just because you consider yourself X and you not supposed to agree with Y doesn mean that there can be some overlap in your ideologies. Have an open mind, don play sides. For example, me putting "" likes reddit and soy"""" at the top of this may have made this entire post seem retarded to some of you, and it would be my hope that instead of this way of thinking you could find value in other parts of it. Dont give in to your own confirmation bias. This is a problem I see all the time and it is so, so goddamn annoying. Next I want to talk about cultural appropriation. Before watching you all argue about this shit, I honestly had no idea what it was and I kind of thought it was a social experiment or something. I been doing research for a couple hrs so hopefully this is coherent, I first try to give my own take on it then talk about some posts here. First, I wanna define cultural appropriation as I understand it so this has a foundation of some kind. Feel free to correct me if Im wrong about this definition, its important to agree on stuff like this beforehand so it doesnt just devolve into an argument about semantics, which is boring as shit. There were also some complaints that some OPs didnt understand what cultural appropriation was to begin with, so its probably easier to get this out of the way. Simply put, it seems that cultural appropriation is when one culture adopts ideas or practices from another. As to what culture is, I like this definition that I found online: the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people. In this case, a culture is less a group of people and more an entity that embodies a certain set of ideas, which is the definition Id prefer to go with. And to appropriate is to take without permission and use for ones own purposes. I saw some mentioning of the idea of cultural misappropriation, but I think it makes more sense to group the two together into a single concept of cultural appropriation. Now for my thoughts. Very, very generally speaking, I believe that cultural appropriation is not inherently bad or good. It just is. I suppose getting a little deeper into it Id lean towards it being a good thing, as we are, in fact, people. Humanity is beautiful in its perfections, imperfections, and everything in between, and by culturally landlocking yourself you are subverting what it means to be human. Everything that we know and understand about ourselves, everything that we enjoy, and everyone we love is a product of the global spread of ideas that has been taking place since the beginning of time. I saw an interesting take in a Huffington Post article (jesus christ, I know its not a scholarly source but Im not talking about any of the god awful content, just one idea) which is that when it comes to cultural appropriation, people should go by the general rule of celebrate, dont appropriate. Its kind of cheesy, but it makes sense at first. But after thinking a bit about it, to this, Id ask the question: are these two things not one in the same? Appropriation is celebration; the appropriated elements wouldnt have been appropriated if they werent found to be interesting or moving in some way/shape/form. Conversely, celebration is appropriation; in fact, acknowledging that some element of culture even exists is appropriation, as youre making yourself and others aware of it and letting it affect other aspects of your character and soul, and by extension your own culture. So I suppose that in order to be wholly against cultural appropriation, you have to be against all exchange of culture and therefore culture as a whole. A counter argument: to the claim that appropriation is celebration, one might say that if you appropriate some element of culture for your own personal gain or to intentionally negatively affect the other party, that this is not a form of celebration. This will be controversial, but Id argue that it is, in fact, celebration, and it requires going back to my point about humanitys perfections and imperfections. It would be nice if we lived in a la dee da utopia, but we dont, and we never, ever will. For our own sake, its necessary that our culture reflect this. Although its shitty for someone to take an idea and call it their own, thats something that people will never stop doing. That concept is part of global culture, it is ingrained into each and every one of us. The existence of evil cant be ignored. Thus, (and this is a little more philosophical/theoretical because idk thats just how I rationalized this) we must not let ourselves become highly sensitized to the worlds problems. In fact, we have to celebrate them, learn from them, experience them, and keep moving forward. And on a cultural scale, this means letting things be as they must. Without cultural appropriation, jazz likely would never have left New Orleans, the modern hip hop scene wouldnt be nearly as prolific, the Spaghetti Western wouldnt exist, the fields of philosophy and literature and any other art would be entirely stagnant, and so, so much more. You could definitely argue that if things were different it would be better or worse, but my argument is that, at the end of the day, it doesnt matter. All of the things that people do, including cultural appropriation, are a part of culture, and these things are what make earth what it is at any given point in time. Advocating against cultural appropriation is advocating against the fundamentals of what separates us from animals: our meaningful interactions and relationships with one another on every scale. We are one species, we grow and change together; not separately. On a side note: there are many topics in modern politics like the opposition to cultural appropriation that, although their intentions seem somewhat sound and wholesome, end up having the opposite effect of creating controversy and divisiveness where there previously was none or less. I hate seeing friends of mine no longer speak to each over shit like this. Its retarded. Our objective should be to achieve unity, not alienation. Think about the implications of a movement you support before getting your pitchforks. Post from earlier is interesting. Most of the comments provided basically nothing of value or shit unfunny twitter reaction images that my mom might find good (aka, nothing of value), but there were a couple that at least had some meat on them that I want to talk about after OP. I disagree with their initial statement about there being nothing wrong with cultural appropriation, because truthfully there is some level of wrong with everything, it just a question of magnitude. As far as the rest of the post goes, its kind of articulated retardedly, and theres an unnecessary mention of race and its overall a little hostile, but if you can see past that I think that this person shares some of my views on this topic. Starting with something that [redacted] mentioned about OP equating cultural appropriation and exchange, Id ask him to refer to what I said above about celebration/appropriation and all that. Id argue that these two things are the same. And if thats not something you can agree with, then I think you may be able to agree that they are at least part of the same practice, they just differ in their extent. As for your first >le funny greentext, I completely agree. I dont know why the fuck OP brought up race to begin with. I just hope that by this you dont mean that cultural appropriation isnt a global phenomenon that has an effect on all people, regardless of ethnicity of background, when this clearly is the case. And for your last >tfw, same as your second one, refer to above about humanity and evil, etc. And to add on to that, because I obviously do understand that cultural appropriation does stir up frustration with the party being appropriated, I think its important to address the short term vs. the long term (too tired to finish this argument someone else do it, [redacted] gave a good response and made a case for why cultural appropriation can be bad, and assuming that she would concede the fact that cultural appropriation can be both good and bad, Id ask her to refer to what I said above about how it doesnt really matter and both good and bad things are a part of the global process of evolution culturally, politically, artistically, and probably every other ally there is (even if she doesnt agree that it can be good, the bad alone can satisfy this argument). To expand upon the example I gave about the field of philosophy; that field thrives based off of taking ideas from one person, twisting it in your own way, and sending it back out into the world. And to relate this to the example you give about bindis, is it not the same idea? Taking something from someone else, spinning it in your own way, and showing it off. Call it bad, call it good, again, it doesnt matter. It just is, and this is how the world is driven forward. And to get into this particular example, Id argue that the appropriation of the bindi could be a beneficial thing. You mentioned that people wearing bindis can be the targets of ridicule. If a coachella girl (whatever the fuck that is) appropriates the bindi and makes it trendy, would that not save some legitimate bindi wearers from said ridicule? Im kind of tired so this might not make any sense, bear with me pls. Id be interested to hear your thoughts. For what cultural appropriation is interpreted as here on campus, [redacted] makes a good point too. But this goes back to creating unnecessary divisiveness: it would be (hopefully inarguably) better if the world could see past race and instead of having white culture, black culture, etc, just have culture. But maybe Im thinking too idealistically. Maybe there is no escape from separating people into categories, and Im actually just a big fucking retard. Lmk Ive become very tired now, i will sleep soon Additionally, nobody addressed what I thought anons strongest point was, which was that cultural appropriation brings people together. Again, my argument for that is above. [redacted] kind of started to bring it up, but instead he just accused OP of not knowing what the fuck he was talking about which was stupid, you could have blessed op with a definition. Id love to hear some arguments to this because Im very interested in this topic this took a lot longer than I expected, ty for reading I wanted to talk about the trump flag thing but that can wait, I have to study for a thing and sleep, Ill do it tomorrow, big kek, follow my soundcloud A"""

The combination of the football posts and the Trump flag posts has shown me theres actually a huge overlap between the people defending the football team and the people not just defending but supporting the Trump flag. These people tend to be large white males with low emotion stares in their profile pics. Their cover photo is usually them with an arm wrapped around another large white male, with an American flag or sports field in the background. Their sentences are usually structured in a simplistic way, with some fancy words thrown in there, not necessarily in the right context. And to make sure Im addressing all sides (so that no one likes me), theres definitely some common themes among progressive commenters. Problematic, toxic, and thats a lot to unpack are common words/phrases. Usually their profile pic is them smiling almost too much, as leaves fall around them, or maybe theyre in a sunflower field. They often use memes and write long rebuttals to moderate claims that arent particularly controversial. Centrists usually wear suits or other mainstream clothing in their pro pics, defend free speech a lot, clarify that they do not like Trump, and generally have points of view that arent very compelling but are also too subtle to be rebutted."""

8528,2019-10-02 12:57:00," topics: trump discourse What so many of you on this page don realize is that MOST TRUMP SUPPORTERS AREN RACIST. They don support racism, they don agree with his racism. Likewise for sexism, xenophobia, islamophobia, etc. The reason they support Trump is because they think that delicate issues (including social issues) CANNOT be effectively handled by the federal government. The government has an absurd amount of waste every year, and policies that the vast majority of Americans agree upon still fail to get passed. The point of the Republican party is to encourage all those that don like how things are done on the national level to be able to take up those issues and choose for yourself how to deal with them on a local level. Want more affordable housing? Talk to the Providence city council. Want to help those who are starving? Donate to local churches or food banks. Want to reduce racism? Volunteer at campaigns that bring people of different races together. This will do much more than your vote for president ever will. Of course Trump has done lots of things that you believe are bad for the country. But please just take a second to recognize that those things aren objectively badyour opinion of those being bad comes from your perspective/background/experiences, and given other experiences you could easily say that even though it horrible that Trump promotes racism, he still doing more good for society than harm. Sometimes Brown gets so obsessed with preventing people from being triggered or offended that it forgets there are things more important than not being offended: discovering truth, growing both socially and financially as a nation, and progressing science, among other things. If you considered actually understanding why dozens of millions of Americans are making decisions or thinking in a way that is (to you) obviously wrong, we get significantly more done as a nation than if you just claim all Trump supporters are racist or stupid."""

Let me preface this by saying Im a Democrat, and a strong one at that. First, if someone wants to hang up a Trump flag, they are well within their rights to do so. Supporting Trump does not mean someone is inherently evil... almost half of the country voted for him and likes him, and few are racists and xenophobes like you brazenly proclaim. There are legitimate reasons to support Trump for many people. You dont have to agree with them (I sure dont), but by creating a political climate in which anyone supporting the other side is called out for being evil and racist and xenophobic, etc. you further the problem of intense polarization plaguing the nation. Instead of ranting anonymously on Dear Blueno, next time you see a Trump supporter, why dont you go up to them and ask why they support him and have a legitimate civilized discussion about it? Figure out why they believe what they believe, and if you disagree, try to change their mind. Thats how political change is made. Not through inflammatory anonymous posts on social media. This sort of thing also creates such a climate of not being able to speak your mind, to the point where I would be concerned for my own safety should I post this response publicly as a comment.

8728,2019-09-30 03:37:00," Hot take: the Brown student body would be way better if it narrowed the number of seats going to children of wealthy donors. There is such a gross habit among the .% privileged to only hang out together (and maybe pull in a few """""" if they considerate). Take the party bus a group of girls my year got for the Harvard Brown game. They are legit too important to ride the normal people buses. More importantly, an invite to this special club meant being in the friend group, which requires having important parents. You can justify this by saying "" what, if they wealthy they can do what they want with their money"""" because most Brown students are no stranger to wealth. The barrier to entry is extreme wealth and parental connections, not just enough wealth to go on fancy vacations. They are on a completely different level of problematic. I don completely blame the girls for doing this, especially because every year has a friend circle that implicitly has an "" parent application."""" In other words, this isn an isolated incident. Even though you can Google the net worth of everyone parents on that bus, I can find you photos of person parties where every invite is the child of celebrity level wealth or connections or both. These parties are not the granoff dinners! They are set up by Brown students! Can you imagine. Anyway, Brown is partially responsible for creating this culture through admissions. Some may argue that donations in admissions are important for financial aid and whatnot. So then why not make it a competition for the highest bidding families to receive admission this route? Admission is already bought under the table, so why not get each individual donation to be as high as possible, choose the highest, and pollute the student body a little less? The rest can get in if they genuinely contribute something as an individual, which is highly possible given the opportunities these people have. If there a better solution to this problem, I wouldn be surprised. Not saying mine is perfect by any means. The main thing I trying to convey is the really classist problem Brown creates for itself. I just sick of the next level wealthy people waltzing right in with their attitudes of doing whatever they want, while being in a student body that should be somewhat socially aware and intelligent. It seems extremely tone deaf to me, and is a reason Brown is not as incredible as it could be. Like this school is so wonderful, yet there are pockets of people Brown smuggles in through admissions that make this place feel commoditized and corporate. Since not all wealthy people are like this, it a reflection of truly how many seats Brown sets aside for people with parents like this. There enough for exclusive cults to exist in an institution where people are also doing serious work for the better social good. What a juxtaposition. """

Its like none of you have ever used an anonymous online forum. Also everyone who says yeah but my comments will help people change their minds about problematic things no they wont. This page is genuinely just an echo chamber and even if people read posts on here it wont change their minds about anything. (Even this post wont change your mind.) Truly this page should have been like a Dear Abby thing where people ask for advice instead of allowing for discourse on problematic things because that discourse will never do anything positive to change things. Additionally, SO many of you immediately jump down the throat of a post you dont agree with and say pretty nasty things to them. Have you considered maybe having the benefit of the doubt because they might not have had the same privileged upbringing as you to know about some things? Tbh when people drag each other on here for whatever reason its mostly just to get whatever dumb internet brownie points they want for dragging them the hardest and getting the most likes instead of being patient and kind and explaining respectfully. Listen, I get it. Im a queer WOC am I tired of having to explain to people when theyre being problematic or have a problematic outlook on some of my identities? OF COURSE I AM. But if Ive learned anything about having kind conversations with misguided people is that those people are definitely willing to learn if you give them a chance. This forum is not the place for these kind of discussions because OPs have no accountability for what they post and are likely to stick to their guns a lot more and because comments replying back to them are usually aggressive instead of compassionate. Am I advocating to excuse ignorant behavior? No. Im saying if you want people to actually change their minds and learn then you have to be patient (in a time when nobody has any patience left nobody said it would be easy). This is not even to say of the hundreds of posts that get posted here of people replying to certain OPs or commenters and utterly ripping them apart or calling them stupid or ridiculous or otherwise making fun of them. Dear Blueno says it doesnt allow for people to directly target others but this is clearly directed. Its cyberbullying and none of you are learning how to communicate effectively and compassionately with anyone who disagrees with you. This is a lot of the reason why conservative media paints liberals as crying special snowflakes because nobody is willing to consider why someone might think a certain way before they jump right down their throats.

Calling people islamophobic and refusing to acknowledge the hurtful comments made by Muslim identifying students and those who claim membership in BDS only serves to delegitimize your cause even more. Hate speech against anyone is never okay, regardless of whether your target is white or a POC, a Muslim or a Jew. It is not okay to label a people as colonizers and murderers, a people who have been enslaved, burned at the stake, exterminated in gas chambers, and mowed down by machine gun fire. Nor is it okay to say that they deserved to die. Jews should not label people like that or wish a horrible fate on Muslims, Christians, or any other. Therefore, it follows that Muslims should not label people as such or wish this fate upon Jews or any other. It hurts to see such intelligent people here at Brown align themselves with a movement that houses this kind of rhetoric, and I can only hope that people of the Brown Muslim community and BDS condemn their members that talk that way. Aside from making Jews feel unsafe worshipping on campus, BDS and what it stands for is an ugly stain on a university that believes higher education should be a place welcome for people of all backgrounds."

An initially small groups of political radicals who continually make radical and false predictions (e.g. that the sea should covered Florida times by now) about the dire situation that can only be solved if someone listens to them. Groups who solutions require major changes to every facet of society which allows for extreme abuse. When the plan to combat climate change requires enlarged government power to mandate environmental policy both to businesses and to individuals, when the industries pushed against just so happen to be dominated by the group traditional enemies (see here the breakdown of energy worker demographics), and when the push for climate change uses high pressure tactics focusing on how YOU and YOUR CHILDREN will DIE and the nation and the world are ruined, people have reasons to be wary. Some people who are suspicious of climate change are solely in denial, some are greedy and self interested, and some are worried about the concentration and abuse of power. The worst thing that can happen is not a clean planet, nor is it a health future for the human race; the worst thing that can happen is the usage of a manufactured catastrophe by a select few to dupe the masses of humanity to gain and abuse power. TLDR: the thing that climate deniers think that people have to gain from climate change is unprecedented power in the hands of those willing to lie to obtain it."""

Occupying so much space and putting on airs in order to garner votes in order to advance yourself is what repels so many people from wanting to participate or understand the role of student governance. Brown has had good moments in terms of student led change historically, but the creeping disease of campaign culture makes me question the value of the existence of student government in its current capacity. People will say its just how it is, and its just a bare sliver of actual politics in its degeneracy, but if we truly are an institution that values independent critical thinking, then reject those who try and hijack the concept of a popular election. Yes this is a large school, and its infeasible that every student knows about the actions of student government, or the individuals that want to join it; but if you have a moment to go to a meeting and actually see what happens and the people actions in the space, I think that would help us all. Don rely on the words of someone who will be sure to deliver every statement as a form of campaign support for their next election, but find out on your own.

Both of these plastics are pollutants, and lets not forget that it is the harmful nature of polypropylene on ocean life, including sea turtles, that motivated our successful ban on plastic straws. If we recognize the necessity to ban plastic straws, then we can recognize the necessity to ban the rest of disposable plastic eatery as well. A small purchase by Brown University Dining Services of just a couple more hundred metal utensil sets in dining halls with utensil shortages, such as the Ratty, could make a huge difference.

Me being me, you eventually got stuck in my head, for you are so good at the things that you are passionate about the things that I also love, but also never good enough at, so I just keep on wanting to be a friend, an acquaintance even just so that I can get to know more about the awesome person or at least in my head that you are. But the dynamic of our first connection left me at a difficult place I don know if I should reach out to you to grab coffee, if I should be a bit more friendly when I run into you on the streets, which happens quite often, just because it would divert a bit from the norm, and because I scared of the uncertainty of how it would turn out to be. I perhaps have done things that I am not totally proud of, and I don really know how to move forward, but I just want you to know that you are so awesome a person and your love for the people and your passions is really warm, and contagious, and let see where our connection will lead us."

9548,2019-09-12 09:52:00," Hello students of Brown University! Its phenomenal to be here with you tonight. Its an honor and a privilege. Its a privilege because through Brown you all control the future of your lives. Its why you wade through the CS all nighters and econ snek ridicule to get to the good stuff. Well what is the good stuff? The good stuff is answering the greatest question of our time: why the heck have sophomores been forced onto meal plan How did that happen? If you scroll Dear Blueno posts, you might get a cocktail of answers. Some mixture of food insecurity, lack of grocery stores, malnutrition, helping U FLi students, covering spring break mealsbut the numbers tell a different story, and Im a numbers guy. The numbers tell a very clear and distinct story that the reason why sophomores have been forced onto meal plan this year is that weve automated away on campus jobs in Jos, Little Jos, Andrews, The Ratty, The Ivy Room, and The Blue Roomall the crucial places where the Bon Apptit Management Company needed to cutback costs for lost revenue, and did cutback on. We are here together at Brown University, the hub of dank memes, and what we did to the cashier jobs we will now do to the homework grader jobs, the student caller jobs, the food prep jobs, the welcome desk jobs, and on and on throughout the university. How many of you have noticed your favorite food missing from the dining halls you go to? And why are those food gone? One word answer: overenrollment. Brown University is soaking up $. billion in federal endowments every single yearhow much have they thought ahead about financially supporting an extra incoming freshmen through the Brown Promise? Zero. Less than the amount of fucks every STEM concentrator here at this university gives to their S/NC WRIT requirement. That is the math. $. billion in. thought back. Most lenient on campus job is being a cashier at the Campus Market. The average cashier on campus is a yr old first year making between and dollars an hour. When shes replaced by a vending machine, what is her next move going to be? When you go complain to ResLife about you summer housing assignment and you get that bot, what do you do? Whats your next move? If youre like me, you go , representative, representative, human, human, until you get someone on the line, right? In or years, the sofwares gonna sound like this: Hey Blueno, hows it going? What can I do for you? :^) . You might not even realize its software. Its going to be delightful, seamless, efficient. What does that mean for the students that work on campus call reception jobs making $ an hour? Being a BUDS worker is the most common job among % of the student body that works on campus, and my friends at Silicon Valley are working on robotic workers that make curry, cook pasta, cook pizza, make sandwiches, and take meal credits without swiping. They are % of the way there. What is that going to mean or the Brunonians who work at BUDS part time right now? Or the students who are hungry for chicken nuggets, spicy withs, and mozz sticks that rely on Jos to have the food they crave after a drunk night of partying? We talk about it like BUDS is the cause of all our problems. They are not. The decline of Jos is a symptom. It is a manifestation. Were going through the greatest student body transformation in our universitys historywhat experts are calling the Dining Revolution. Whens the last time you heard a politician say Dining Revolution? Just now. And I am barely a politician! So the question is: what are Brown Democrats going to do about it? We have to make it known to our fellow students that it is not high school employees that are causing these problems, it is admissions oversight. High school BUDS workers are getting scapegoated for something they have n o t h I n g to do with. So the question is: How do we solve this problem for the Brown student? We have to take a new vision to our fellow students as fast as possible. If youve ever heard anything about me and my campaign, youve heard something like this: Theres an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone $ flex points a month. You remember hearing that? You remember the first time you heard that? Nothing quite like the first time am I right?? First time you heard it, it seemed like a gimmick. Seemed like theres no way that would ever happen. But if you dig into our universitys history, you find this is a deeply Brunonian idea. John Brown was for it at the founding of our universitycalled it the students dividend. Inman Page championed it and fought for it in the , and it was what he was fighting for up to the day he graduated in . A hundred staff members endorsed it in the and was so mainstream that it was approved in financial aid board meetings twice in as the Meal Assistance Plan. And years later one state passed a dividend where new every student in that university system receives between $ $ in meal credits a yearno questions asked. And what university is that? University of Alaska!! And how do they pay fund it? Oil!!!! And what is the oil of Brown University? Memes, thats right!! ResLife memes, Granoff dinner memes, Ratty memes, Blueno memes. A study from Cornell University just came out that said that your memesour memesare now worth more than oil. How many of you received your meme check in the mail room? None of us. In the University of Alaska school system they call it the Oil Check, and they love it. Were gonna call this the Meme Check, and all of Brunonias gonna love it. And I want you to think about what $ in Flex Points would mean in our school lives. It would mean stronger friendships, higher graduation rates, lower stress levels, eradicated sexual assault. It would start to recognize the work thats actually being done in our student groups. Every single day it would create hundreds of full stomachs, would supercharge the arts, creativity, volunteerism, culture, and student government engagement. This is the vision that will win in . I get it. Im an operator. The action happens on the ground. We have to empower our students on the ground. How many of you were excited about admission rates when you woke up this morning? How many of your were like Im gonna make a big contribution today, I can feel it! If you think about it, were at record low admission rates and record high incoming student body sizes. Also at record highs at this university right now: student dropout rates, drug overdose, anxiety, depression, food insecurity. Its gotten so bad that our graduation rate has declined for the last years in a row. Last time our graduation rate declined years in a row? The Spanish Flu of . Global pandemic. Thats the last time it happened. We need to evolve to the next set of measurements. And I talk about my daughter whos at university with her two young boysone of whom is autistichow much better does the Brown Promise alleviate her struggle coupled with an overadmitted incoming class size every year? Zero. And we know thats nonsense. We know it should be the opposite of the truth. We know that her sacrificeI was off the trail for a couple days taking care of my grandkids, and you know what I said after two days? Get me back to running for president as soon as possible. And if youre a parent you know exactly what Im talking about. Its the hardest work there isbut the most important. Instead of this low admission rate/large incoming class measurement thats running us off a cliff, we should be measuring our shared progress through health and retention rates. Mental health and freedom from substance abuse. Good food, good campus markets. Academic success benchmarks. This is the vision of a student body that would actually work for the Brown student body. Right now, Brown Democrats are being cast as the group that wants the option to get off meal plan. We want to move meal plans forward, and we need the right measurements to do that. So this is the vision we have to take to the rest of the university as fast as possible. We have to solve the problems that got sophomores stuck on a subpar meal plan. If you remember in what did Josiah Carberry say? He said Were gonna Make Jos Great Again. And then what did C. Pax respond? Jos is already great. And that did not. Quite. Work. His solutions were garbage and nonsense. He said were gonna remove the vending machines, turn the clock back, were gonna bring the chicken nuggets back. We have to do the opposite of all that. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our student body and meal plans. We have to evolve in the way we think about university dining and satisfaction. And I am the ideal candidate for that job, because the opposite of Josiah Carberry is an Asian man who likes memes. Thank you very much Brown! Thank you very much. Lets Make Every Meal Excellent, and win! John Yang """
9549,2019-09-12 09:52:00," The way people greet me versus people greet other people are like night and day. Their eyes lighten up, huge grins, they get excited and so happy. None of which happens when people see me... actually it more likely that they avert their eyes and pretend they didn see anything. Nobody really happy to see me. I always been that de facto weird kid that nobody really likes. Not outright hatred, but you can tell how people are always uncomfortable when they talk to me. And I always wondered why. Am I a bad person and have a shitty personality? Am I creepy? Am I socially stunted? Probably yes to all three, so since coming to Brown I tried whatever it took to make myself a better person. Joined a ton of clubs, tried meeting all different kinds of people, always tried to reach out to people in classes and clubs, tried to be super nice and friendly. Went to service to try to help other people. Went to CAPS to resolve these psychological issues. Adjusted my weight to try improving my self confidence. Helped other people around school whenever possible. I tried my best to be the best person I could. I given everything I could, even my self worth, to others. Sadly, it not enough. I must still be an asshole, a creep, a faux pas generator, because things are still the same. The way people treat me is just so noticeably different from the way everyone else is treated. Everyone just tolerates me at best. I feel stuck. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I will always be that kid with weird vibes that makes people go "" fuck..."""" and try to avoid. Maybe this is the role I have been assigned to in this world, and I should just play my part. Maybe, yeah, I guess it just life."""

For those of you who dont know, hes been blatantly left out of news graphics showing the top polling candidates, showing whos in the debate, etc. Google Yang Media Blackout for more info. Anyway, its gotten to the point where its clearly not a coincidence that so many outlets are essentially denying his existence in so many ways. Despite polling in , hes had fewer articles and stories about him than almost any candidate. For Bernie fans out there, doesnt this remind you of ? Intentional or not, this censorship is dangerous, especially when the non establishment candidates are so disproportionately effected.
